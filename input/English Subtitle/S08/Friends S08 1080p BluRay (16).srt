1
00:00:06,923 --> 00:00:10,551
I'm sorry, did you just say it's Rachel?

2
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:13,637
Yes.

3
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,475
Um, you like Rachel?

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,647
Yes. I like Rachel.

5
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,364
Rachel?

6
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:35,951
Yeah. Okay, but look, you know...

7
00:00:36,161 --> 00:00:38,495
You know who else I like? You.

8
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:42,499
And it doesn't get said enough.
I like you, Ross.

9
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:47,212
- "Rachel" Rachel?
- It's not a big deal.

10
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:50,883
It's not a big deal?
I'm sorry, I just...

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,344
What about the stuff you said?

12
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:59,266
How you can't stop thinking about her?
How you can't sleep?

13
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:01,268
I'm an actor, you know?

14
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:05,397
As a group, we tend to be
overdramatic.

15
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:08,817
Rachel-who's-carrying-my-baby Rachel?

16
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:12,446
I know it's bad.
And I know it's wrong, okay?

17
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:15,783
It's not like anything's
ever gonna happen.

18
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,994
These are just feelings.
They'll go away.

19
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,747
You know, I gotta go.

20
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:23,290
Hey, Ross...

21
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:27,461
You know, I just have one...
Rachel?

22
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,675
Rachel?

23
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,182
Rachel?

24
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:23,892
Oh, oh! Okay, she's kicking.

25
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,354
She's growing inside you.

26
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:28,605
- Whoa!
- Oh.

27
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:33,360
- That was a big one.
- That's the youngest girl to reject me.

28
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:35,779
- You guys!
- Hey there.

29
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,283
Let me ask you.
Do you believe in soul mates?

30
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,784
Oh, yes, I do.

31
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:43,787
There's one person out there
for everyone.

32
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,999
You know how you find him?
Stop looking.

33
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,252
I've stopped looking
for Russell Crowe.

34
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,296
He'll find me.

35
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,630
Uh-huh. And you?

36
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:59,094
No. I believe that, uh, certain people are
more suited for each other, but...

37
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,930
- Soul mates? I don't think they exist.
- Good.

38
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,933
- Why?
- Well, last night, I met Monica's.

39
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,023
- What?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:15,152
I had a date with this guy.
I swear he's her other half.

41
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:20,532
You don't think there's somebody
better suited for Monica than me?

42
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,704
Well, what's he like?

43
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:29,333
- He's tall. He has brown hair.
- Of course.

44
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:34,004
A tall guy with hair similar to mine?
Oh, unknowable universe!

45
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,257
- He works with food.
- Oh, sure. Older?

46
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,968
- Obviously. And he's British.
- I was just gonna ask!

47
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:45,682
Yeah? And he's so centered,
and mature and confident.

48
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:48,352
It's so sad they never met.

49
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:53,148
Luckily, the guy she settled for
can't hear you.

50
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,151
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Maybe I'm wrong.

51
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,321
We're going out again.
I'll find out more.

52
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,491
He's meant for her,
and you're gonna date him?

53
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,953
He may not be my soul mate,
but a girl's gotta eat.

54
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,168
- Hey.
- Hey.

55
00:04:13,336 --> 00:04:16,588
I talked to Joey.
I wanted to see you.

56
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,884
I still can't believe it.
Joey and Rachel?

57
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,221
It's like you and me going out,
only weirder.

58
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,307
I know you're hurting...

59
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,518
...but don't say that again.

60
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:35,440
What if they marry?
He'd be the stepfather of my child.

61
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,776
You don't need to worry.

62
00:04:38,027 --> 00:04:40,487
He'll never tell her how he feels.

63
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:43,615
If he did, you don't know
how she'd react.

64
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:47,828
Sure, women never like Joey.
I think he's a virgin.

65
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:52,833
- He isn't thinking about going for her.
- He's not?

66
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,753
All he's thinking about
is how you're taking this.

67
00:04:57,005 --> 00:05:00,924
It's freaking him out.
He wants to move to Vermont.

68
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,470
- Why?
- He wants to leave the country.

69
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,935
He thinks you hate him.

70
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,730
Hate him?

71
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,859
No, I don't hate him.

72
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,281
It's just, it's Rachel. You know?

73
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:28,618
I can't even imagine how hard
this must be for you...

74
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,831
...but I don't want you
to lose Joey over it.

75
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:37,461
Right now, he needs to know
that you're still his friend.

76
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,757
Okay, I'll talk to him.

77
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,675
I'd do it soon.

78
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:48,805
He just asked me how to convert
his dollars into Vermont money.

79
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:57,147
- Oh, hi!
- Hi.

80
00:05:57,357 --> 00:06:00,609
- Chandler, Monica, this is Don.
- Hello.

81
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,778
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:04,780
Soul mate.

83
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:11,286
- What are you guys doing?
- We had lunch at Adriatica.

84
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:16,166
- What's with the sun-dried tomatoes?
- I know! Is this 1985?

85
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:20,087
- That's what I said! Isn't it strange?
- Not really.

86
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,965
What's wrong with sun-dried tomatoes?

87
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:28,678
On a barbecued-chicken pizza?

88
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,347
No?

89
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:35,394
- What restaurants do you like?
- Octavio. 27-and-7.

90
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:39,940
- There's this place, Alessandro's.
- Oh, my God! I'm the chef!

91
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,984
You're kidding!
Your food is fantastic!

92
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:47,322
I want to talk about your menu.
Anyone want coffee?

93
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,826
If you're talking about me,
I'll go with you.

94
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:55,205
What are you doing?

95
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,209
I swear, I didn't know you guys
would be here.

96
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,878
You don't believe in soul mates, so...

97
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:06,049
I believe in handsome strangers
who hit on my wife.

98
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:11,471
Just because I think they're soul mates
doesn't mean anything'll happen.

99
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,015
- Phoebe? Good work.
- Yeah?

100
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,893
He's great. I love him.

101
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,524
Don't worry, we'll find you
someone else.

102
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:34,369
- Hey.
- Hey.

103
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:39,374
I understand if you came by to hit me.
I deserve it.

104
00:07:39,584 --> 00:07:41,877
No, I don't want to hit you.

105
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:44,588
What, then? Kick me?

106
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,173
No.

107
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,884
Bite me?

108
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,137
I don't want to do anything to you.

109
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:55,599
I just want to say I'm not
mad at you...

110
00:07:57,059 --> 00:08:00,395
...and that I certainly
do not hate you.

111
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,191
I just came here to say that.

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,735
Hey, wait, Ross?

113
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:11,907
You wanna come in
for a beer or something?

114
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,077
Yeah, sure.

115
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:22,501
You got any beer?

116
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,590
All I got is melon stuff
that Rachel left.

117
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,425
Okay.

118
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:41,186
You need to understand something.

119
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:49,444
I am never gonna act
on this Rachel thing, okay?

120
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:54,491
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize
my friendship with you.

121
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:57,327
Thank you.

122
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,293
Mm.

123
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:18,181
Anyway, it'll just...

124
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:21,768
It'll take me a while to get over her.

125
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:26,147
I'm not sure how to do that.
I've never been in love, so...

126
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,899
What?

127
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,029
You're in love with her?

128
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:37,993
- Yeah. I thought you knew that.
- Um, no.

129
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:44,291
Look, if it helps, I don't want
to feel this way, honest.

130
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,878
I just keep thinking,
"I'll get over this," you know?

131
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,049
But it just keeps getting harder.

132
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,720
I don't know what to do, you know?

133
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,348
What do I do?

134
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:12,360
- You need to tell her how you feel.
- That's the green stuff talking.

135
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:17,866
I'm serious.
You need to find out where she is.

136
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:22,037
If she's not where you are,
you can start to move on.

137
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,415
But what if,
and I'm not saying she will be...

138
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,960
If she is where you are...

139
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:35,717
...then my feeling weird
shouldn't stand in the way.

140
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,803
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

141
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,932
If she ends up with somebody else...

142
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:47,062
...the truth is,
she couldn't find a better guy.

143
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,606
Hey, thanks.

144
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:56,196
- So when are you gonna talk to her?
- Oh, my God. I have to tell her.

145
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,784
I haven't thought about it.
What should I say?

146
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:03,578
I'm understanding,
but let's not get carried away.

147
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:06,998
Right, sorry. Sorry.

148
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,376
What am I gonna say?

149
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:15,757
Yeah, tell me about it.

150
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:35,235
I'm phasing out the wine importing
and focusing more on the, um, cheese.

151
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:37,362
Cheese, you say?

152
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,949
That's some
pretty smelly work, huh, Don?

153
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:45,161
- Excuse me?
- Cheese. It's smelly.

154
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,541
You must smell a lot of the time too.

155
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:55,964
Uh, not really. But with cheese,
I think the smellier, the better.

156
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,885
Me too! Chandler hates it.
I can't have blue cheese in the house.

157
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,180
And you're still married to him?

158
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:14,065
I would like to go to France and eat
nothing but bread and cheese.

159
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,568
Not even bread. Just cheese.

160
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,695
No, I want the bread.

161
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,322
And pastries.

162
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:23,658
And pâté.

163
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:27,704
I'm really not high.
I just used to be fat.

164
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:32,041
I have a villa in the Loire Valley
you can stay in.

165
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,377
Is it made of cheese?

166
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,925
No. A house made of cheese,
wouldn't that be great?

167
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,012
- I'd move in tomorrow!
- Oh, come on!

168
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,016
- Listen to this!
- I'm so sorry.

169
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:52,520
- What do we do?
- They both want a house of cheese.

170
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:56,107
I don't know how you fight that.

171
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:06,868
Okay, okay. I can do this.
I can tell her how I feel.

172
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,454
Okay, stand up straight.

173
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,582
Take a couple deep breaths.

174
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,085
Look confident.

175
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,925
Joey? What's up?

176
00:13:22,176 --> 00:13:26,554
I came by because
I want to talk to you about something.

177
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,847
What's up?

178
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:31,226
Here, in the hall?
What are we, animals?

179
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,896
I'm late for a meeting.
Could you make it quick?

180
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:38,733
I just came by to tell you that...

181
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:42,987
...I want to have dinner with you.

182
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:47,784
- Sure. Just tell me where to meet you.
- Okay.

183
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,287
Okay. That's good.

184
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,833
That gives you a couple of hours
to prepare.

185
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,378
Don't you people ever knock?

186
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,715
I'd like to have Don and Phoebe over.

187
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,384
Sure. Set it up.

188
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,846
I'll just be browsing
through the personals.

189
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,349
Are you okay?
You're acting weird.

190
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Yeah. Fine.

191
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,185
Not perfect.

192
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:16,312
But good enough.

193
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,398
Jeez, what's with you?

194
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:21,651
I'm sorry, did you say "cheese"?

195
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:27,323
- What's going on?
- Phoebe says you and Don are soul mates.

196
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,785
I don't believe in that,
but you two get along.

197
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:36,291
I'll step aside if you wanna go with
Don and live in a house of cheese.

198
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:41,629
- You don't believe in soul mates?
- No, but I'm sure "tomatoes" does.

199
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:46,050
I don't believe in soul mates, either.

200
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,552
- You don't?
- Nope.

201
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,388
We weren't destined
to end up together.

202
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,225
We fell in love and work hard
at our relationship.

203
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,145
Some days we work really hard.

204
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:01,983
So you don't want to live with Don
in a cheese house?

205
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:08,197
No, I've had second thoughts.
Do you know how hard it'd be to clean?

206
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:10,909
- I love you.
- I know.

207
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,661
I'm gonna take you out to dinner.

208
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:18,291
I found this place that makes the greatest
mozzarella sticks and jalapeño poppers.

209
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,045
No? They taste so good.

210
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,846
It happens whenever Chandler
touches my stomach.

211
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,933
I'm worried the baby won't like him.

212
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:41,230
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, sure.

213
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:46,736
Uh, look, the reason...

214
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,823
Is it hot in here?

215
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,285
No, not for me.
Why don't you take off your sweater?

216
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,246
This is a nice place...

217
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:02,293
...and my T-shirt has a picture
of Calvin doing Hobbes.

218
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:06,297
Oh, my God, really? Can I see it?

219
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,757
Yeah, sure.

220
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:14,263
I wouldn't think Hobbes
would like that so much.

221
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,058
Uh...

222
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,397
How long have we known each other?

223
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,233
Um, seven, eight...

224
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,527
Eight years. Wow.

225
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,821
- Uh-huh. A long time.
- Yeah.

226
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,158
But over the past few weeks, I...

227
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,913
Okay! Sorry about the wait,
but it is mega-jammed in here.

228
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,873
Our specials tonight...

229
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,751
- Could you give us a second?
- Sure.

230
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,253
Second's up!

231
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,093
Not that kind of table.

232
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,931
So you were saying?

233
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,018
I'm not sure.

234
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:04,981
You asked how long we knew each other,
and I said eight years.

235
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:09,652
Then the waiter came over
and cut his tip in half...

236
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,406
...and now here we are.

237
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,826
Yeah. Here we are.

238
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,996
Uh...

239
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,464
I think I'm falling in love with you.

240
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,217
What?

241
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,222
I'm falling in love with you.

242
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,566
Who are you talking to?

243
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,945
Oh, you're kidding. It's a joke.

244
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,907
Funny. It's funny!

245
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,242
I don't get it.

246
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:04,582
Oh.

247
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,170
Okay.

248
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,509
Wow.

249
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:19,055
Are you, um?

250
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,227
How did, um?

251
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,562
When?

252
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,400
Does it really matter?

253
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,905
Wow. Wow.

254
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:38,366
It is hot in here.

255
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,284
I know this is a lot.

256
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,788
You don't have to say anything.

257
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,251
You take as much time as you need.

258
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:57,552
Okay, you gotta say something.

259
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:03,015
Joey, I love you so much.

260
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,309
- But...
- But.

261
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,603
Joey?

262
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,481
Right. Hey, that's, uh...

263
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,025
That's okay. That's fine.

264
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:18,156
It's, uh, pretty much
what I was expecting.

265
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,118
It's no big deal, all right?

266
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:29,083
- I think I'm gonna go.
- Please don't leave like this.

267
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:33,045
You can't do this to a pregnant woman!

268
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,548
Don't start doing that.

269
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:39,343
You can't do that,
because you're gonna make me...

270
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,554
Oh, there we go!

271
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:47,143
- Can I?
- Sure.

272
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:51,606
Oh, Joey. I don't want to lose...

273
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,941
Hey, hey.

274
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:59,488
You can't, okay? Ever.

275
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:03,201
I'm so sorry.

276
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,495
Please don't be sorry.

277
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,956
Okay? Don't be sorry.

278
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:20,176
You know, I was only kidding.

279
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,763
Yeah, that was a real good one.

280
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,317
- Is this your table?
- Yeah.

281
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:39,028
- You'll be here all night.
- I know.

282
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,864
I haven't even read the specials.

283
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,824
What's the matter?

284
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:48,829
I don't know.
I think maybe one of them is dying.

285
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,168
I kind of hope it's the girl.

286
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,256
The guy is really cute!
