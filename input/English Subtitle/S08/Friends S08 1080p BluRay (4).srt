1
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:10,884
Wait. Before we go in, I just
want you to know that I love you.

2
00:00:11,052 --> 00:00:13,887
And I had a great time
on our honeymoon.

3
00:00:14,055 --> 00:00:17,725
I can't wait to go in there and spend
the rest of our life together.

4
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,060
You're sticking with
the shell necklace, huh?

5
00:00:21,896 --> 00:00:23,897
- Hey, you're back! Woo-hoo!
- Yay!

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,360
- Come on in!
- Yeah, come on!

7
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,115
How was the honeymoon?

8
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:37,661
So much fun. The best part is, we met
this incredible couple on the flight back.

9
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:42,374
That was the best part?
Good honeymooning, tiger.

10
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,794
They're cool.
They were on their honeymoon too.

11
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:48,088
They're terrific. They live here in the city.

12
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:52,092
Can we go call them? Is it too soon to call?
I wanna call.

13
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,888
Sorry, we're excited. We finally
have a couple to hang out with.

14
00:00:56,056 --> 00:01:00,976
A couple? Like two people?
Like one, two people?

15
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,730
This is different.
Greg and Jenny are in a relationship.

16
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,233
Ugh, Greg and Jenny. Ugh!
"Hi, Greg. I'm Chandler. This is Monica."

17
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,736
"Hi, Monica. This is Jenny."
"Hi, Jenny. Hi, Greg."

18
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:16,909
- Listen, they're great. If you got a chance...
- You know what?

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,537
Why don't you give us our souvenirs
and get the hell out of here.

20
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:25,375
- We didn't get a chance to...
- You've got to be kidding me!

21
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:29,755
- We didn't get anything for anyone.
- Mm-hm, yeah. Nice necklace.

22
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:33,967
That you can have.

23
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,589
- Hi.
- Hey!

24
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,925
- Hello!
- Welcome home.

25
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:16,927
So, how was the honeymoon?

26
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:20,097
Great! How about you?
I mean, you're having a baby!

27
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:24,393
- Oh, look, I have a sonogram picture.
- Oh, good.

28
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:29,106
Ross, it's got your wavy, black lines.

29
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,443
So now that Ross knows,
can you tell us how it happened?

30
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,280
When did it happen?
How many times did it happen?

31
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,866
- Monica, that's not right.
- What?

32
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,367
Start with where.

33
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,623
Well, it happened about six weeks ago.

34
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:50,210
And, uh, I had just got home from work
and Ross was already there.

35
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:54,381
- I guess he'd been hanging out with Joey.
- You're welcome, buddy.

36
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,137
Yeah, thanks.

37
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:05,809
And so I had a lot of work, and Ross,
nice guy that he is, offered to help me out.

38
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,770
And then we had wine,
we got to talking.

39
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:12,274
Next thing you know,
out of nowhere Ross comes on to me.

40
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,109
Um, heh. That's...

41
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,945
That's a little misleading.

42
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,365
- What is?
- The lie you just told.

43
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:25,287
- That you came on to me?
- There's the one!

44
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:28,957
- But you did. Let's be honest.
- Yes, let's.

45
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,503
You know what? Uh, it's not important.

46
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,048
Heh, what's important is
that we're having a baby.

47
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,592
It doesn't matter who came on to who.

48
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:40,928
"Whom."

49
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,724
That's right.

50
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,562
- You kissed me first.
- What? You were begging me to kiss you!

51
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:53,273
You were sending me signals
all over the place.

52
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,275
- I was sending signals? Please.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,904
Okay, anyone think that
I'd actually send Ross begging signals?

54
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,864
Please, show of hands.

55
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:08,330
It doesn't matter what people "believe."
What matters is what happened.

56
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:11,458
These signals, explain this.
Maybe I need to be more careful.

57
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,835
Am I you sending these signals
right now?

58
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:18,674
- You know what? Just drop it.
- Show me how I begged you.

59
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,218
I can show you!
I have it on videotape.

60
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,812
It's an expression.

61
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,237
I can't believe he taped
the two of them having sex.

62
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,532
Yeah. You gotta tell a girl
before you tape her.

63
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:47,494
Such a rookie mistake.

64
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:51,665
- Know who has a great camera?
- Greg and Jenny?

65
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:54,960
- Do you want to call them? I want to.
- Let's call.

66
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:57,421
Ask them if they brought
their friends souvenirs.

67
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,471
Hello? 8th Street Deli?

68
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,726
Hey, hang up. You get food poisoning
just talking to that place.

69
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,021
- Sorry, wrong number.
- Here you go, babe.

70
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,609
Hello? It's the deli again!

71
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:21,945
All right, I'll have a sandwich.

72
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,448
I don't think this number's right.

73
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:32,581
- What?
- You got fake-numbered.

74
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:37,836
- What? People don't do that.
- Oh, I think we do.

75
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:41,131
- A fake number? Why would they do that?
- I don't know.

76
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:43,008
You were a delight to talk to.

77
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:45,552
You asked those insightful,
great questions.

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,095
And you've never been funnier.

79
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,724
I mean, joke, joke, joke!
You were a hoot!

80
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,518
Don't worry about it.
You still got me and Phoebe.

81
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,605
Excuse me, I don't want
Greg and Jenny's rejects.

82
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,819
Rachel won't talk to me.
She won't open the door.

83
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,030
Hmm, I wonder why, pervert.

84
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,741
Okay, listen, I am not a pervert.

85
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:10,243
That's, like, the pervert motto.

86
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,163
Yeah, they have you
raise your right hand...

87
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,083
...put your left hand down your pants
and repeat that.

88
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,212
Filming Rachel was not
something I planned.

89
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,673
Look, here's what happened.
And Joey can back me up on this.

90
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,469
About a month and a half ago,
remember I came to you with a problem?

91
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,554
Um, a...

92
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,640
The personal thing?

93
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:37,437
- Pers...? What personal thing?
- About... About sex?

94
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:40,857
That I hadn't had sex in months?

95
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,612
Yeah, I knew what
you were talking about.

96
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:53,745
- Hey.
- Hey.

97
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:56,456
Do you have a minute?

98
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,127
I'd like to talk about something
I'm uncomfortable talking about.

99
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,045
Sure, yeah.

100
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,425
How about, uh,
you showering with your mom?

101
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:10,762
I actually had a topic in mind.

102
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:20,355
I'm kind of going through
a dry spell, sex-wise.

103
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:23,483
- Oh, for, like, months?
- Five, to be...

104
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,569
...lying. Six.

105
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,321
Six months? That's rough.

106
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:33,201
Well, it's not all bad. I'm learning to
appreciate the, uh, small things in life.

107
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:38,707
Like the sound of a bird,
or the color of the sky.

108
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:42,669
The sky's blue, Ross.
And I had sex yesterday.

109
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:47,507
Please help me.
I have a date tonight.

110
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:51,011
It has to go well.
I'm scared for my health.

111
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:56,016
Okay, okay. Oh! I got something.
It's this story that I came up with.

112
00:07:56,225 --> 00:08:00,061
Very romantic.
Any woman that hears it, they're like putty.

113
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,855
Really? Tell it to me.

114
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,775
Okay. Now, you're gonna want to have sex
with me when you hear it.

115
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:10,071
But you have to remember,
it is just the story.

116
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:16,328
- I'll try to control myself.
- Okay. Ahem.

117
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,707
Years ago, when I was backpacking
across Western Europe...

118
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,919
Heh, you were backpacking
across Europe?

119
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,922
- Have a nice six more months, Ross.
- Okay, okay!

120
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:32,761
I'm sorry. Please, please.
You were in Western Europe, and?

121
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:39,893
I was outside Barcelona, hiking
in the foothills of Mount Tibidabo.

122
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:46,942
I was at the end of this path.
I came to a clearing, and there was a lake.

123
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:51,238
Very secluded.
There were tall trees all around.

124
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:55,075
It was dead silent. Gorgeous.

125
00:08:55,326 --> 00:09:01,248
And across the lake I saw
a beautiful woman bathing herself.

126
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,417
But she was crying.

127
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,587
Why?

128
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:16,805
Mm! Mm, this is great wine.

129
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:19,349
It's from France.

130
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:23,353
In Europe.

131
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:26,147
Western Europe.

132
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:34,072
You know, um, a few years ago
I was backpacking across Western Europe.

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,034
- Really?
- Mm-hm. Wait, it gets better.

134
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,706
Um, yeah, I was in, um, Barcelona.

135
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:46,793
I studied for a year in Barcelona.

136
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,716
- Anyway, um, so I was hiking...
- I love hiking!

137
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,926
Oh, that's great!

138
00:09:56,762 --> 00:10:01,308
I was hiking along the foothills
of Mount Tibidaybo...

139
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,645
- I think it's "Tibidabo."
- Okay, do you want to tell the story?

140
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,568
Whoa, what are you doing here?
How'd your date go?

141
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,613
Great. I'm across the street
having sex right now.

142
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:21,328
- Your story sucks.
- If it didn't work, you didn't tell it right.

143
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,914
- Show me how you did it.
- No, I don't want to.

144
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:30,462
- How long since you seen a girl naked?
- I was backpacking across Western Europe.

145
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:35,925
- I'm not feeling it.
- I was outside Barcelona, hiking...

146
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:41,806
- No, Ross, I'm not hot. Are you hot?
- It's been six months. I'm always hot.

147
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,061
You're not selling the story.
You don't believe it.

148
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:49,272
I gotta go, I got a date.
But try this.

149
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:52,067
Do what I do
when I'm preparing for an audition.

150
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,069
I'll set you up with my video camera.

151
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:57,155
You can record yourself
and see what you're doing wrong.

152
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,948
I'll try that.

153
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,911
All right. Now, you're all set up.
Good to go.

154
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,330
- Just hit record. Good luck.
- Thanks.

155
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,292
And Joe, listen. If you ever have
any problem with the ladies...

156
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,503
...you know I'll help you out.

157
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,468
That means a lot to me, man.

158
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,569
Hello.

159
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:43,410
Can I get you anything?
Lens cleaner? Your battery okay?

160
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:45,787
- Rachel.
- Oh, Ross.

161
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,414
- Hi.
- Thank God you're here.

162
00:11:47,581 --> 00:11:50,542
You have to help me.
Were you just talking to yourself?

163
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:55,505
That's less embarrassing.
Yes. Yes, I was.

164
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:59,759
When she came in, I got distracted
and totally forgot about the camera.

165
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:03,054
It kept rolling and recorded everything.

166
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:08,476
- Yeah, we're gonna need to see that tape.
- Yeah.

167
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:13,189
What a great idea!
That'll get Rachel to forgive me.

168
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,443
This is not fair to her.
Let's forget the tape.

169
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,403
Thank you.

170
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,405
You'll show it to me.

171
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,701
- No.
- You're right.

172
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:30,248
- Joey, no.
- Loud and clear.

173
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,966
I don't get why Greg and Jenny
would give us a fake number.

174
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,635
You know, if they knew
what they were doing...

175
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:46,181
...they didn't give you real names either.
- Okay.

176
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,226
Maybe people give out fake numbers,
but they don't give out fake names.

177
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,853
Oh, yeah?

178
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,147
Hi. Ken Adams. Nice to meet you.

179
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,068
Regina Phalange.

180
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,530
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- I know.

181
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:08,036
Although you did tell
an awful lot of jokes.

182
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:12,707
I thought you said those jokes
were funny. Joke, joke, joke!

183
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,042
Joke, joke...

184
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,551
- Maybe it was your questions.
- What about my questions?

185
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:27,806
The sheer volume.
It was like flying with the Riddler.

186
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:34,187
- Ooh, sorry, was that another joke?
- Was that another question?

187
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:39,901
- Hey, is Ross still here?
- Uh, no, Rach, he's gone, but listen.

188
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,571
He told us what happened.
It sounds like an honest mistake.

189
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:48,535
Really? How would you like it if I had sex
with you and I taped it?

190
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,995
Oh, forget it.

191
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:57,836
Oh, there he is, the father of my child,
the porn king of the West Village.

192
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,172
Look, it was an accident, okay?

193
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,676
I feel bad it happened.
I swear, I didn't even watch it.

194
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,720
Anyway, here.

195
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:11,891
I thought you might be more comfortable
destroying it yourself.

196
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,143
Thank you.

197
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,402
What?

198
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,533
- You don't want to see this, do you?
- Hell, yeah!

199
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,245
I am not gonna show you this.

200
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:36,291
Not the sex part.
Just the stuff leading up to it.

201
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,668
Forget it. She's destroying it.

202
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:42,255
Okay, fine! Fine. We'll just have to think
of some other way...

203
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,674
...to put the "who came on to who"
thing to rest.

204
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:47,176
Come on now, think!

205
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:52,891
Forget it. It's Rachel's tape,
and she can do whatever she wants with it.

206
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,562
And she wants to destroy it,
so end of story.

207
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,649
- I want to see it.
- What?

208
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,027
Clearly you don't want people
to see this tape.

209
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:06,195
I don't want people
to see this tape either.

210
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:10,575
But you so badly don't want people to see
it that it makes me want to see it. See?

211
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:15,663
Are we watching the tape or not?

212
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:22,045
- I don't want people to see it for your sake.
- Oh, I don't believe you.

213
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,298
I think you don't want them
to see you begging me.

214
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:31,095
- Rachel, please?
- Oh, a little preview.

215
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:37,977
Fine. But I want the record to show
that I tried to take the high road.

216
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:40,939
Because in about five minutes,
I'm gonna be saying:

217
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,282
Okay, here we go.

218
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:54,577
Hello. Can I can get you anything?

219
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,996
I'm so happy.

220
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,502
Oh, thank God you're here.

221
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,046
I need you to help me.
Were you talking to yourself?

222
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:09,258
- Oh, there I am.
- You're gonna get pregnant.

223
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:11,636
I screwed up so bad.

224
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:17,141
I told Monica that I'd stuff and send
those wedding invitations weeks ago.

225
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,476
You didn't do it?

226
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,187
I had put them in...
In my desk at work...

227
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:24,273
...and I forgot about them until today.

228
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:32,448
Sweetie, it's okay.
Everybody made it to the wedding. I'm fine.

229
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:37,161
- Kind of hurting my hand though.
- I know.

230
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,122
I can not believe that I did this.

231
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:43,001
Especially after Monica
just went on and on and on about it.

232
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:47,588
"Here are the invitations, Rachel.
Be very careful, Rachel.

233
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,842
Please drinking no liquids
around the invitations, Rachel."

234
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,261
Whoa, oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

235
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,430
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!

236
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,063
Did you do it on our invitations?

237
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,154
Not on the ones we sent out.

238
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,784
So just the ones you gave back to us
and we had framed?

239
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,793
Can you believe this is happening?

240
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:29,881
- It seems like yesterday they got engaged.
- I know.

241
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:35,219
Remember the night they got engaged?
How you and I almost...

242
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:38,389
Oh, I remember how we almost.

243
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:42,685
You think we would've gone through with it
if we hadn't gotten caught?

244
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:45,563
You think we would have done it?

245
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:51,903
I know I wanted to.
I just wasn't sure if you wanted to.

246
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,947
Oh, I wanted to.

247
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:59,952
So we... We both wanted to.

248
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:03,081
- Interesting.
- Mm.

249
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:11,297
Anyway, um,
probably worked out for the best.

250
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,258
Yeah, sure.

251
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:17,053
In about 10 seconds,
you're gonna see him kiss me.

252
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:21,349
And in about 5 seconds,
you're gonna see why.

253
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,938
Ross, did I ever tell you about the time...

254
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,525
...that I went backpacking
through Western Europe?

255
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:40,409
Okay, get ready to see some begging.

256
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,579
Oh, you came on to Ross!

257
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:47,667
- What?
- Now I'm so happy.

258
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:52,046
- What are you talking about?
- You used the Europe story!

259
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,675
That's the magic story you use
when you want to have sex!

260
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:03,182
- How do you know about that story?
- How do you know about that story?

261
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:06,811
I heard it from my friend Irene
who heard it from some guy.

262
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,689
Some guy!

263
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,153
No, no, she told me that
his name was Ken Adams.

264
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,532
Ken Adams!

265
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,251
Hi.

266
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,088
So apparently, uh, people are familiar
with the Europe story?

267
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:36,132
Yeah, listen, about that...

268
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:40,219
...the whole "who came on to who"
thing really doesn't matter.

269
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,347
I think it would have happened
either way.

270
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:47,393
I mean, if you hadn't initiated it,
I know I would have.

271
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:53,566
- It was an amazing night.
- It was. It was an amazing night.

272
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,280
You think it looked amazing?

273
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:05,119
I, uh... I don't know.
I honestly didn't watch it.

274
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,079
Yeah, me neither.

275
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,457
Yet.

276
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:14,003
Uh...

277
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:18,716
- That... That may be weird.
- Yeah, it would be really weird.

278
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,980
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you.

279
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,318
- Mind if I mute?
- Oh, please.

280
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:42,573
- Oh, there go the clothes.
- You are undressing awfully quickly.

281
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,952
Six months, Rachel. Six months.

282
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:49,080
- Huh.
- Huh.

283
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,501
- Huh.
- Hey. Heh.

284
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:58,589
- We look pretty good.
- I was gonna say.

285
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:01,842
- Ooh, nice tan.
- Thank you.

286
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,346
- I'd just gone to the beach that weekend.
- Ah.

287
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,974
Ugh.

288
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:12,895
- Have you been working out?
- I have been working out.

289
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:16,565
Well, this is so much better than I ever...

290
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,067
- Oh.
- Oh.

291
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,821
- Ew.
- Ew.

292
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,200
- Oh, that's not pretty.
- Oh.

293
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,077
- Oh. Oh, God.
- Oh.

294
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,622
- Oh, no. Oh, no! No!
- Make it stop. Make it stop.

295
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,381
Hello, Greg?
Hi, this is Monica from the plane.

296
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:44,468
Listen, the number that
you gave me, uh, 8-5-3...

297
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:47,722
Their old number! Jenny's been
giving it out since they moved!

298
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,851
- Jenny! That is so Jenny!
- I know.

299
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:55,938
Listen, um, how would you like to
get together next Saturday?

300
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,316
Okay, how about Sunday?

301
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:01,193
Okay, um, the week after that?

302
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,987
The week after that?

303
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,947
You know what, Greg? Heh.

304
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:09,410
We are good, interesting,
funny people with good questions.

305
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:13,456
And if you and your precious Jenny
can't see that, then...

306
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,333
January 15?

307
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,127
We'll see you then! Okay!
