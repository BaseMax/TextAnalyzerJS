1
00:00:02,157 --> 00:00:03,616
Previously on Friends:

2
00:00:03,783 --> 00:00:05,994
Seventeen hours, I have been at this.

3
00:00:06,161 --> 00:00:08,329
- How many centimeters am I dilated?
- Three.

4
00:00:08,538 --> 00:00:12,000
Just three? I'm dilated three.

5
00:00:13,042 --> 00:00:16,379
- We've talk about having babies someday.
- So we're gonna try?

6
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:19,883
- Right here?
- No, not here.

7
00:00:20,049 --> 00:00:22,343
Maybe here.

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:24,262
This is your grandmother's
engagement ring.

9
00:00:24,429 --> 00:00:26,222
I want you to give it to Rachel.

10
00:00:26,389 --> 00:00:28,766
- Mom, no.
- Ross, this isn't just some girl...

11
00:00:28,933 --> 00:00:33,021
...you picked up in a bar and humped.

12
00:00:34,105 --> 00:00:36,649
- Hey, I take it you're visiting someone?
- Uh-huh, yeah.

13
00:00:36,816 --> 00:00:39,068
- Wanna visit someone else?
- Yeah, I would like that.

14
00:00:40,403 --> 00:00:42,363
- That's him.
- Great. Well, go get him.

15
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,282
Or maybe you could go in first.

16
00:00:44,449 --> 00:00:48,244
Hi, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray.
I have a few routine questions.

17
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:50,872
Do you sleep with women
and never call them again?

18
00:00:52,123 --> 00:00:56,753
Oh, my God.

19
00:01:07,013 --> 00:01:10,808
Should we tell Rachel there's an empty,
private room right next door to hers?

20
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:15,104
We could. Or we could have sex in it.

21
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,484
Well, let me think about that.
While I remove my pants.

22
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:25,365
Okay, mister. Fertilize me.

23
00:01:36,834 --> 00:01:39,546
Does that sound like Janice?

24
00:01:39,712 --> 00:01:42,632
If it's not, then there's two of them.

25
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,051
And that would mean
it's the end of the world.

26
00:02:26,634 --> 00:02:27,677
H93'-

27
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:29,053
- Hey.
- Hi.

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,098
I can't believe this is taking so long.
How are you doing?

29
00:02:32,265 --> 00:02:34,267
Oh, not bad. You know that feeling...

30
00:02:34,434 --> 00:02:37,478
...when you're trying to blow
a Saint Bernard out your ass?

31
00:02:40,565 --> 00:02:42,317
Weirdest thing. Did I hear...?

32
00:02:43,901 --> 00:02:45,987
Mother of God, it's true.

33
00:02:46,904 --> 00:02:50,908
Chandler Bing.

34
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:52,076
Janice.

35
00:02:52,243 --> 00:02:56,789
Notjust Janice. Janice in labor.
Contracting and everything.

36
00:02:58,249 --> 00:03:01,586
Oh, this should be easy.
I have a very wide pelvis.

37
00:03:01,753 --> 00:03:03,796
You remember, Chandler.

38
00:03:07,258 --> 00:03:09,010
Janice, I didn't know you were pregnant.

39
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:13,473
Who's the unwitting human
whose essence you've stolen?

40
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:17,310
It's you.

41
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:19,604
This is yours.

42
00:03:20,146 --> 00:03:21,397
What?

43
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:25,234
Ha, look how nervous he gets!
We haven't slept together in years!

44
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:31,699
That's funny. Does it hurt?
Does the labor hurt?

45
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:38,748
Okay, I've got one for you.
If you had to, which would you rather eat?

46
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:42,460
A Seeing Eye dog or a talking gorilla?

47
00:03:45,755 --> 00:03:49,175
I'd have to say the talking gorilla.

48
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:53,763
Because at least I could explain to him
that you're making me eat him.

49
00:03:54,514 --> 00:03:58,017
- Oh. Somebody went to college.
- Yeah.

50
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:00,436
Wow. What is it? I'm sorry.

51
00:04:00,603 --> 00:04:03,523
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just my foot itches like crazy.

52
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,150
On. I'll get it.

53
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:11,572
Wow. I usually get to know a girl better
before I let her spoon me.

54
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:15,493
Relax. It's not like we're forking.

55
00:04:18,204 --> 00:04:21,290
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

56
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:28,214
Oh, that's five, Ross.
Five women have had five babies...

57
00:04:28,381 --> 00:04:30,800
...and I have had no babies.

58
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:32,969
Why doesn't she want to come out?

59
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:35,638
You know what I think it is?

60
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:38,099
I think you made such a nice
home for her...

61
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:41,394
...over the last nine months
that she just doesn't want to leave.

62
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:46,733
Oh. Look at you making up crap for me.

63
00:04:48,693 --> 00:04:51,821
- Oh, God. Ooh, ooh...
- Okay. Okay.

64
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,657
Twenty-one hours. You're a hero.

65
00:04:54,824 --> 00:04:57,285
Doctor, you gotta do something.
You gotta give me drugs...

66
00:04:57,452 --> 00:05:00,913
...or you gotta light a fire up in there
and just smoke it out.

67
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:05,960
Actually, I think you're ready to go
to the delivery room.

68
00:05:07,044 --> 00:05:08,838
- What?
- Ten centimeters.

69
00:05:09,547 --> 00:05:10,840
You're about to become a mom.

70
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:15,219
Oh, my God. Okay.

71
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:20,224
Ha-ha-ha, beat you, sucker. Oh, baby.

72
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:31,152
Oh, my God. That's the doctor
who was in my room before.

73
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,782
Oh. Okay, Mr. Percocet.

74
00:05:37,825 --> 00:05:41,037
I'm telling you, the guy
from that show was here...

75
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:44,832
...in my room,
asking me all these weird questions.

76
00:05:44,999 --> 00:05:48,961
Cliff, do you really believe that a character
from a TV show was here in your room?

77
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,047
Rachel's having her baby.

78
00:05:54,008 --> 00:05:56,302
That's him. You know him?

79
00:05:57,011 --> 00:06:00,765
Okay. Okay. I... Okay. Um... This...

80
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:04,852
I sent my friend, Joey,
in here to find out stuff about you.

81
00:06:05,019 --> 00:06:08,981
Um, if it, you know...
If it helps, you came off great.

82
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:11,734
A lot better than I'm coming off
right now.

83
00:06:13,069 --> 00:06:17,114
I don't believe this. You got him
to pretend he was some fake doctor?

84
00:06:17,281 --> 00:06:20,827
Fake? Excuse me? Hello?

85
00:06:21,953 --> 00:06:24,205
And then you tried
to make me think that I was crazy?

86
00:06:24,372 --> 00:06:27,959
You're right, that was wrong.
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

87
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,754
It's just that I liked you so much.
Can we just start over?

88
00:06:32,588 --> 00:06:33,756
I don't think so.

89
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:35,800
Uh, if I may?

90
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:39,136
Look, Cliff, you told me a lot
of personal stuff about you, right?

91
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:43,224
Now, maybe it would help if you knew
some personal stuff about her.

92
00:06:43,432 --> 00:06:47,895
Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer.

93
00:06:48,062 --> 00:06:52,358
Uh, she gave birth
to her brother's triplets.

94
00:06:54,193 --> 00:06:58,990
Oh, oh, oh.
Her twin sister used to do porn.

95
00:06:59,866 --> 00:07:03,244
- Joey, we're trying to dial down the crazy.
- Right.

96
00:07:04,036 --> 00:07:05,329
Um...

97
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:10,543
Look, we don't really know each other,
so it'd be really easy to just forget this...

98
00:07:10,877 --> 00:07:14,213
...but there seems to be something
between us. And I don't know about you...

99
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:16,632
...but that doesn't happen to me a lot.

100
00:07:19,051 --> 00:07:22,763
- It doesn't happen to me, either.
- Me, neither.

101
00:07:25,725 --> 00:07:28,269
- Push.Push.
- Ooh, ooh, ooh...

102
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:30,313
We're gonna push for five more seconds.

103
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,189
Five, four...

104
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:34,358
Three, two, one. Oh!

105
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:38,863
Okay, the next contraction
should be in about 20 seconds.

106
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,824
- I can't. I can't push anymore.
- Sweetie, you're doing great.

107
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:45,202
Oh, God. Twenty seconds, my ass!

108
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:47,788
Here we go. Okay, keep pushing.

109
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:49,832
- Come on.
- Push. Wait.

110
00:07:49,999 --> 00:07:53,669
- I see something.
- What, you do? You do? Oh, my God.

111
00:07:53,836 --> 00:07:55,880
Don't say "Oh, my God."
"Oh, my God," what?

112
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:57,089
What is that?

113
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:59,759
That's the baby's buttocks. She's breech.

114
00:07:59,926 --> 00:08:02,929
- Oh, my God. I thought she had two heads.
- Oh, God.

115
00:08:04,305 --> 00:08:05,556
Is she gonna be okay?

116
00:08:05,723 --> 00:08:07,099
- She's gonna be fine.
- Yeah.

117
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,519
She's in a more difficult position,
so you're gonna have to push harder.

118
00:08:10,686 --> 00:08:13,022
- Okay.
- Go. Come on. Go. Go.

119
00:08:13,189 --> 00:08:15,107
Rachel,
you're gonna have to push harder.

120
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:19,528
- I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.
- Yes, you can. I know you can do this.

121
00:08:19,695 --> 00:08:21,197
- Let's go.
- I can't do it.

122
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:24,408
- No, please, you do it for me.
No...

123
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,748
Let's go. One more time.
One final push. Ready? One, two, three.

124
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:33,668
Good.

125
00:08:33,876 --> 00:08:35,169
Keep pushing.

126
00:08:36,963 --> 00:08:39,340
Are you okay?

127
00:08:41,133 --> 00:08:44,971
You have no idea how much this hurts.

128
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:49,308
Keep going! Keep going!

129
00:08:50,476 --> 00:08:52,144
Here we go.

130
00:08:52,311 --> 00:08:54,981
Oh, oh! She's upside down,
but she's coming. She's coming.

131
00:08:55,147 --> 00:08:57,733
- Oh, God!
- Oh. Oh, my God.

132
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,319
Oh, my God, she's here.

133
00:09:03,864 --> 00:09:06,075
Oh, she's perfect.

134
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:10,913
Oh, wow. Oh, she's so tiny.

135
00:09:15,459 --> 00:09:19,588
- Where'd she go?
- They're just wrapping her up.

136
00:09:19,755 --> 00:09:23,300
Okay. Well, be careful with her,
she's really tiny.

137
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:27,430
Here she is.

138
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:37,857
Oh, you.

139
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:41,819
Oh, thanks for coming out of me.

140
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:47,241
I know. Oh.

141
00:09:47,575 --> 00:09:49,368
Yes. Oh.

142
00:09:51,495 --> 00:09:57,126
Oh, she's looking at me. Hi. I know you.

143
00:09:57,918 --> 00:10:00,713
- Do we have a name yet?
- No, not yet.

144
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,633
That's fine. For now we'll just
call her Baby Girl Green.

145
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,012
Oh, no. Baby Girl Geller-Green.

146
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:27,656
Hello, Baby Girl.

147
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,624
- Can we come in?
- Oh, come on in.

148
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:40,336
- Oh, there she is.
- Oh, she's so beautiful.

149
00:10:40,503 --> 00:10:41,962
Here.

150
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:47,176
Oh, my God. She's amazing.

151
00:10:48,427 --> 00:10:51,931
Oh, I'm so glad you guys got drunk
and had sex.

152
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:56,477
It's incredible. I mean,
one minute she's inside you...

153
00:10:56,644 --> 00:10:59,355
...and then 47 hours later, here she is.

154
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:07,530
She looks so real.

155
00:11:09,824 --> 00:11:11,367
You know what I mean.

156
00:11:11,534 --> 00:11:14,370
- Okay, my turn. My turn.
- Aunt Phoebe.

157
00:11:14,537 --> 00:11:19,291
Yes. Oh, baby. Oh, you're so cute.

158
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,003
Oh, I could squeeze your little head.

159
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:26,549
I won't.

160
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:32,221
- Honey, what's the matter?
- Nothing. Sorry, I just can't stop crying.

161
00:11:32,388 --> 00:11:34,723
The doctor said it's completely normal,
with the hormones...

162
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:38,644
- ...plus you're sleep-deprived.
- So? You guys are all sleep-deprived.

163
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:43,190
I don't see you weeping because you
put your slippers on the wrong feet.

164
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,026
Oh, God.

165
00:11:46,193 --> 00:11:49,321
- What's the matter now?
- I was reliving it.

166
00:11:49,989 --> 00:11:51,532
Oh.

167
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,993
So do you know
what you're gonna call her yet?

168
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,246
Oh. Wait a minute,
it's not gonna be Baby Girl?

169
00:11:57,413 --> 00:11:59,123
I thought that was so original.

170
00:12:01,083 --> 00:12:03,919
Uh, actually,
we've narrowed it down to two names.

171
00:12:04,086 --> 00:12:06,088
Yeah, and you know what?
I love them both.

172
00:12:06,255 --> 00:12:09,425
So why don't you just pick one,
and that'll be it.

173
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:15,931
Wow, um, okay. Uh, everyone?

174
00:12:16,098 --> 00:12:18,976
This is Isabella.

175
00:12:20,144 --> 00:12:22,897
- Hi, Isabella.
- Hi.

176
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:31,447
- What?
- That's not her name.

177
00:12:31,614 --> 00:12:34,783
I'm sorry, she just doesn't feel
like an Isabella.

178
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:37,411
- What was the other one, Ross?
- Um, Delilah.

179
00:12:37,578 --> 00:12:41,790
Oh, great. Suddenly she
sounds like a biblical whore.

180
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:49,215
- Ahem, so I guess we're back to Baby Girl.
- Yay.

181
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:51,967
What are we gonna do?

182
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:55,179
- It's okay, honey. You'll find a name.
- Ugh. Easy for you to say.

183
00:12:55,346 --> 00:12:57,848
You already know
what your kids' names are gonna be.

184
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:02,436
- You do?
- Yeah. I had them picked out since I was 14.

185
00:13:02,603 --> 00:13:07,024
Oh, no, it's gonna be named after
some snack or baked good, isn't it?

186
00:13:10,569 --> 00:13:15,950
- Well, tell us, what are they?
- Um, okay. If it's a boy, it's Daniel.

187
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:19,453
- And if it's a girl?
- I don't want to say.

188
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,790
Oh, stop. Tell us.
We're not gonna want it.

189
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,460
Okay. It's Emma.

190
00:13:27,795 --> 00:13:29,672
Emma.

191
00:13:33,509 --> 00:13:35,928
See, I don't want it.

192
00:13:40,766 --> 00:13:43,894
- Take it.
- What?

193
00:13:44,395 --> 00:13:46,438
She's clearly an Emma.

194
00:13:46,605 --> 00:13:48,816
Oh, honey, but you love that name.

195
00:13:49,817 --> 00:13:51,986
Yeah. But I love you more.

196
00:13:53,362 --> 00:13:54,905
Oh.

197
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:59,410
Besides, you know, nothing goes
with Bing. So I'm screwed.

198
00:14:03,706 --> 00:14:05,040
Yoo-hoo.

199
00:14:05,207 --> 00:14:11,130
Aaron Lipman-Guralnick would like
to say hello to his future bride.

200
00:14:11,297 --> 00:14:12,881
Oh.

201
00:14:19,596 --> 00:14:23,142
Wow, he kind of takes your breath away,
doesn't he?

202
00:14:23,309 --> 00:14:25,227
He's a keeper. Ha, ha.

203
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:30,607
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, you know, I'm fine.

204
00:14:32,192 --> 00:14:35,571
Can I just say,
I really admire what you're doing.

205
00:14:35,738 --> 00:14:37,906
Just raising her all alone.

206
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:41,035
Oh, I'm not doing it alone. I have Ross.

207
00:14:41,243 --> 00:14:43,912
Oh, sure. Now.

208
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,707
But what happens when he meets
somebody else and gets married?

209
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:50,627
Well, then he gets a divorce. It's Ross.

210
00:14:53,547 --> 00:14:56,383
I'm telling you, Rachel. Listen to Janice.

211
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,972
They all say they're gonna be there,
until they start their real family.

212
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:06,352
That's never gonna happen with Ross.

213
00:15:06,518 --> 00:15:08,395
That's what I thought
about my first husband.

214
00:15:08,562 --> 00:15:11,523
Now, I'm lucky if my kid gets to spend
the weekend with her father...

215
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:12,983
...and little Miss New-Boobs.

216
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,904
Really?

217
00:15:17,613 --> 00:15:19,490
I hate to be the one to say it...

218
00:15:19,656 --> 00:15:23,702
...but, honey, you two are on your own.

219
00:15:26,246 --> 00:15:29,375
Well, that's, you know, that's...

220
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:32,878
We've been alone for the last
20 minutes and we're doing okay.

221
00:15:34,838 --> 00:15:36,840
You know what?
Maybe we won't be alone.

222
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:39,718
Because lately things
have been happening...

223
00:15:39,885 --> 00:15:41,387
...between me and Ross, you know?

224
00:15:41,553 --> 00:15:46,975
And right before I went into labor,
we had this kiss. You know?

225
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:51,730
So it might be the beginning
of something.

226
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:55,275
- Hey, Janice.
- Oh, hi.

227
00:15:55,442 --> 00:15:59,696
Oh. Who's this little guy?

228
00:16:00,864 --> 00:16:05,327
- Say hello to Aaron, your future son-in-law.
- Oh, no, no. Ha, ha.

229
00:16:05,911 --> 00:16:09,164
- I'm gonna leave you three alone.
- Okay.

230
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:15,129
- Man, you see the kid on that nose?
- Uh-huh.

231
00:16:17,214 --> 00:16:20,008
- You know what I was thinking about?
- Huh?

232
00:16:21,176 --> 00:16:25,931
Um, that kiss before we left
the apartment.

233
00:16:26,098 --> 00:16:28,267
That was something, huh?

234
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,438
Yeah. Yeah, it really was.

235
00:16:32,604 --> 00:16:35,315
But we, we gotta be careful. Heh.

236
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:38,777
We... You know, we can't let
that happen again, you know?

237
00:16:41,572 --> 00:16:42,948
Right.

238
00:16:43,615 --> 00:16:45,367
We don't want to go down that road,
do we?

239
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:49,705
No. No, of course not.
No, that's why I brought it up.

240
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,629
- They didn't have any sodas?
- Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

241
00:16:57,796 --> 00:17:00,632
I was talking to this nurse.
Completely forgot.

242
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:05,596
And so it begins.

243
00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:14,188
She in there?

244
00:17:14,563 --> 00:17:16,899
Yeah. She's putting her down now.
That's her.

245
00:17:17,065 --> 00:17:18,066
Oh.

246
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:21,737
- Look at Emma.
- I can't decide who she looks more like.

247
00:17:21,904 --> 00:17:23,155
You or Rachel?

248
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:27,075
Oh, what, are you kidding?
She's gorgeous. It's all Rachel.

249
00:17:31,497 --> 00:17:36,084
I'm sorry. For the last time,
why aren't you two together again?

250
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:40,714
No, I know.
Because you're not in that place.

251
00:17:40,881 --> 00:17:44,009
Which would be fine,
except you totally are.

252
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:47,513
It's complicated, okay?

253
00:17:48,639 --> 00:17:51,934
Yeah, that's true.
Yeah, you love her, you always have...

254
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,437
...you have a child together.
There's no right answer.

255
00:17:57,272 --> 00:18:00,025
Look, we've been together.
Okay, and then apart.

256
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:02,319
And then together, and then apart.

257
00:18:02,486 --> 00:18:04,738
And now we have a baby.

258
00:18:07,658 --> 00:18:11,995
It's just, if we got together again
and it didn't work out?

259
00:18:12,996 --> 00:18:15,624
I could never do that to Emma.

260
00:18:18,043 --> 00:18:23,507
I mean, she came into this world
thinking everything... Now me.

261
00:18:23,674 --> 00:18:27,302
What, do they put something
in the water in this place?

262
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,807
It's just, Rachel and I,
we're doing really well now.

263
00:18:31,974 --> 00:18:33,809
I know, I know, I know.

264
00:18:33,976 --> 00:18:36,019
If you try to make it more,
you might wreck it.

265
00:18:36,186 --> 00:18:38,397
- Yeah, exactly.
- Right.

266
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:44,778
Or you might get everything
you've wanted since you were 15.

267
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,913
H93'-

268
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:59,126
I just saw a woman breastfeeding
both of her twins at the same time.

269
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:01,628
It is like a freak show up here.

270
00:19:02,713 --> 00:19:04,715
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

271
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:06,675
What is it? Hey?

272
00:19:06,842 --> 00:19:09,970
- Really, it's nothing. I'm...
- Rach, come on. What?

273
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:17,102
I've just been thinking about how
my baby and I are gonna be all alone.

274
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:20,147
What are you talking about: "alone"?
What about Ross?

275
00:19:20,314 --> 00:19:25,485
Oh, please. He'll be with his real family.
The twins and little Miss New-Boobs.

276
00:19:26,695 --> 00:19:29,281
Okay, how long
was I watching that woman?

277
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,118
I'm just saying that, you know...

278
00:19:33,327 --> 00:19:36,538
...someday Ross is gonna
meet somebody...

279
00:19:36,705 --> 00:19:39,082
...and he's gonna have his own life.

280
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,001
Right?

281
00:19:41,877 --> 00:19:43,754
Yeah, I guess so.

282
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:50,218
I just never thought I'd be raising
this baby all by myself.

283
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:53,347
Pretty dumb, huh?

284
00:19:53,513 --> 00:19:56,266
Hey, you listen to me. Listen to me.

285
00:19:56,808 --> 00:20:01,104
You are never, ever gonna be alone.

286
00:20:01,271 --> 00:20:05,150
Okay? I promise I won't let that happen.

287
00:20:07,027 --> 00:20:11,406
Oh, Joey. Oh, sweetie,
what would I do without you?

288
00:20:12,949 --> 00:20:16,536
You don't have to worry about that,
okay?

289
00:20:20,957 --> 00:20:23,585
Oh, honey, could you grab me
my other box of tissues?

290
00:20:23,752 --> 00:20:25,504
They're right on that chair
under Ross' coat.

291
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:26,963
Sure.

292
00:20:35,555 --> 00:20:37,432
Oh, my God.

293
00:20:38,975 --> 00:20:40,018
Joey?

294
00:20:43,105 --> 00:20:44,981
Oh, my God.

295
00:20:50,862 --> 00:20:52,072
Okay.

296
00:21:27,733 --> 00:21:30,527
- That was amazing.
- I know.

297
00:21:32,529 --> 00:21:38,368
Hey, do you realize that we may have
just changed our lives forever?

298
00:21:38,535 --> 00:21:40,120
We may have started our family.

299
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,581
Nine months from now,
we could be here...

300
00:21:42,748 --> 00:21:44,916
...having our own baby.

301
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,336
And if not, we got to do it on a bucket.
