1
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:07,965
Joey? Are you in there?

2
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,968
- Oh, my God, that's Rachel.
- Joey, you have to talk to her.

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:14,888
No, I can't. Not after the other night.
It's just... It's too weird, okay?

4
00:00:15,056 --> 00:00:17,099
Don't tell her I'm here.

5
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:20,644
Don't eat that.

6
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,105
- Hey.
- Rach.

7
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,982
- Hey, Rachel.
- Is Joey here?

8
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,276
- I don't see him. You see him?
- I don't see him.

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:30,946
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.

10
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,615
Well, at least you make
each other laugh.

11
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,619
- What's up?
- Well, I haven't seen him since that night...

12
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:40,748
...that he told me how he, you know...

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:43,584
I don't know,
I think he's avoiding me.

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:44,960
Why is that bagel on the floor?

15
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,758
- We were playing a game.
- Ew, was Chandler naked?

16
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:56,221
Sort of like a ring-toss
kind of situation?

17
00:00:56,806 --> 00:01:00,017
- Sure.
- What? No. No.

18
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,689
All right, well, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that, uh?

19
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,691
Tell him I miss him.

20
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:17,076
- Okay. Did you hear that?
- Yeah. That naked bagel game? Heh.

21
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,997
Dude, I don't know.
That's a pretty small hole.

22
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,544
- Honey, you've gotta talk to her.
- I can't.

23
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,547
You guys don't know what it's like
to put yourself out there like that...

24
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:31,965
...and then just get shot down.

25
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,426
I don't know what that's like?

26
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:38,764
Up until I was 25, I thought the only
response to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."

27
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,016
Hello. No rejection?

28
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,103
I got shot down at fat camp.

29
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,815
Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.

30
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,152
All right, so, what do I do?

31
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:55,572
This is Rachel. What are you gonna do,
never talk to her again?

32
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,784
I know it's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.

33
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,871
Yeah, okay.

34
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,791
Whoa. I almost forgot this was on your...

35
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,335
We didn't play it.

36
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,504
Okay, so when you're done with your tea,
I'll look at the leaves and tell your fortune.

37
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,757
- I didn't know you read tea leaves.
- Oh, yeah, I've done it for years.

38
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,260
I actually stopped
because I was so accurate.

39
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,805
You know, and one of the great joys
of life...

40
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:05,100
...is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?

41
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:08,228
And also,
tea tends to give me the trots.

42
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,982
- Okay. I'm done. Read mine.
- Okay.

43
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:15,444
Ooh. I see a ladder.

44
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:19,489
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.

45
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,205
I'm the head chef.
I can't get promoted.

46
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,916
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Who's next?

47
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,752
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.

48
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,420
Okay.

49
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,965
- Um... Oh. Okay, I see a circle.
- Oh.

50
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:40,886
Oh, which can either mean
you're having a baby...

51
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:43,847
...or you're gonna make
a scientific discovery.

52
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:47,726
Well, I have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.

53
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,023
- What does yours say, Pheebs?
- Um... Wow, all right.

54
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,609
Wow. Yay.

55
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,988
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy.
And really soon.

56
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:02,532
And he's gonna be
the man of my dreams.

57
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,202
Probably not the guy
I had a dream about last night.

58
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,912
You.

59
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:12,584
Hey, has anyone seen my shirt?

60
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:16,421
It's a button-down,
like a faded salmon color?

61
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,882
You mean your pink shirt?

62
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,760
Faded salmon color?

63
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:24,471
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.

64
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,308
Great, great. Then I must have
left it at Mona's. I knew it.

65
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:30,727
I'm sure you can get another one
at Ann Taylor's.

66
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,149
That's my favorite shirt, okay?
I love that shirt.

67
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:38,318
Well, just ask Mona to give it back.

68
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,320
I don't know. I mean, I guess I could.

69
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:44,074
It's just, we didn't really end things
on such good terms.

70
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,244
And if I went over there, I'd be ignoring
the one thing she asked me to do...

71
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,331
...when we broke up:
Jump up my own ass and die.

72
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,546
Oh, wait a second, you guys.

73
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,882
For the last couple weeks, I've been
seeing that guy everywhere I go.

74
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:04,553
We take the same bus, we go to
the same bookstore, same dry cleaner.

75
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,430
Maybe he's the tea guy.

76
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,184
Pheebs, did you see that?

77
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:13,562
He totally checked you out
and he is so cute.

78
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:21,361
Mine is a picture of the Village People.
What does that mean?

79
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:28,994
- Hi.
- Hey.

80
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,718
- Hi.
- Hi.

81
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:54,353
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.

82
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,905
I thought Joey and I would be okay
once we hung out...

83
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,824
...but it's like we don't even know
how to be with each other anymore.

84
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:11,745
- I know it's tough, but things will get better.
- How do you know that?

85
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,373
What if it just gets
worse and worse and worse...

86
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,918
...to the point where we can't even
be in the same room with each other?

87
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,754
I'm not great at the advice.

88
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,215
Can I interest you
in a sarcastic comment?

89
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,094
Some cheese?

90
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:34,768
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?

91
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:38,855
Let's just say if I can't find the right
CD case, I just put it in the nearest one.

92
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:42,776
- Okay, well, where is the Cat Stevens CD?
- In the James Taylor case.

93
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,695
- Where's the James Taylor CD?
- Honey, I'm gonna save you some time.

94
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:48,740
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.

95
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:54,955
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.

96
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,165
Okay, um, we're just gonna have to
spend some time...

97
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,834
...and put the CDs in the right cases.

98
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,420
If we're gonna do that,
we should come up with some order.

99
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,213
Like alphabetically, or by genre.

100
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:05,924
Hmm, I don't know.
We really have to talk this through.

101
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:11,012
Oh, my God, you guys have such problems.
I feel so terrible for you.

102
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,975
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

103
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:18,478
Look, you and Joey, you're both focusing
on this uncomfortable thing.

104
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,605
What you need to do
is change the subject.

105
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:23,900
Next time you see him, try to get him
talking about something else.

106
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:25,694
- Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

107
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,156
I don't know, maybe you have
a work problem you need his advice on.

108
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,241
- Ooh, I could do that. I could do that.
- Good.

109
00:07:32,326 --> 00:07:34,744
Honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack?
Really?

110
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,997
They were just giving those away
at the store.

111
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:41,460
In exchange for money.

112
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,505
Hey.

113
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,048
Hi.

114
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:52,804
I really don't know what to tell you, Rach.
I really don't.

115
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:57,601
Maybe Joey could help you out
with your big work problem.

116
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,104
- What?
- Yeah, Joey, she's...

117
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:05,066
Rachel's got this really big work problem.
It is a head-scratcher. Heh.

118
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:10,655
Well, you know what? If we're gonna make
dinner, we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.

119
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:18,288
So you, uh, have a big work problem?

120
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,625
Yeah. It's, um...

121
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,044
Yeah, it's, uh...

122
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,007
You know, it's nothing.

123
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:31,510
Oh. Okay.

124
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:37,349
So, uh, I think I'm gonna take off.

125
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:42,604
No, wait, Joey, it is.
It's something. It's, um...

126
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,356
It's my boss.

127
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,609
- Yeah?
- Yeah. And, um...

128
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,196
And my baby.

129
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:52,948
Yeah?

130
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,326
My boss wants to buy my baby.

131
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:02,249
What? Oh, my... Oh, my God.

132
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,669
I know, I told you,
it's a really big problem.

133
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,631
- He wants to buy your baby?
- Can you believe that?

134
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,551
- That's crazy.
- That's what I told him.

135
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:16,429
- How did this even happen?
- Well, I'll tell you.

136
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:24,813
See, uh, my boss and, uh, his wife,
they can't have children, so, um...

137
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:28,066
And then when we were
at the Christmas party...

138
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:32,862
...and he got drunk and said to me,
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."

139
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:38,368
Man. When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby...

140
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,537
...I figured it was something
about maternity leave.

141
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,832
Oh. Yeah.

142
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:57,762
Yeah, that would have been
a much simpler problem.

143
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,356
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.

144
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:10,567
- Mm-hm.
- I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

145
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:13,236
Jim-Jim Nelson.
I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.

146
00:10:14,822 --> 00:10:16,781
We certainly have been seeing
a lot of each other.

147
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:21,369
We have. Maybe we'll see each other
at dinner tomorrow. Say, around 8:00?

148
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,914
Well, maybe we will.

149
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,626
Oh.

150
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,175
Mona?

151
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,729
Ow.

152
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,786
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be?

153
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:13,505
I am so sorry I spilled wine
all over your shirt.

154
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,633
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's still wet.

155
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:20,845
Let me get it out before it sets.
Oh, I have something you could wear.

156
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:26,393
- Here.
- Oh, uh...

157
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,853
I don't know if I wanna wear
a woman's shirt.

158
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,983
- No, no, that's a man's shirt.
- Awfully pink.

159
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,027
It's not pink.

160
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,075
Oh, my God, honey,
we are so meant to be together.

161
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,871
- Look, we both have the Annie soundtrack.
- Honey, both yours.

162
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,876
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.

163
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,379
- Yeah, the work problem?
- It was perfect.

164
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,798
It felt like he was my friend again.

165
00:11:56,966 --> 00:12:01,553
- What problem did you tell him you have?
- Oh, that's not important.

166
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:06,099
The point is,
I really think everything's gonna be okay.

167
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,394
May I help you?

168
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,314
You think you can just buy
my friend's baby?

169
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,825
Isn't it funny how we kept
running into each other?

170
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,119
It's as if someone really wants us
to be together.

171
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,663
Someone does. Me.

172
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,167
Ooh. Witty banter. Well done. Good.

173
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:36,546
- So tell me a little bit about yourself.
- Oh, okay. Well, I'm a masseuse.

174
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:41,426
- And I used to work at this place...
- Do you like to party?

175
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,555
I... I like parties.

176
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,224
You're wild, aren't you? Heh.

177
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:54,355
- Yeah, I guess. A little.
- Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.

178
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,028
So, um, anyway...

179
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:04,491
...I... I've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, I guess...

180
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,869
...for, um... Well, since I was 14.

181
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,455
I'm sorry. I'm staring.

182
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:14,709
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

183
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,960
Oh, stop it.

184
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,630
And your breasts. Mm!

185
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,218
Okay. Ahem.

186
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:26,179
Look, uh, you're coming on
a little strong.

187
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,515
But I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt.

188
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,935
Because it seems the universe
really wants us to be together.

189
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:36,231
So why don't we start over, okay?
You can just tell me about yourself.

190
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,316
- All right.
- Okay.

191
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:41,444
I write erotic novels...

192
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,154
...for children.

193
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,409
- What?
- They're wildly unpopular.

194
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:51,162
Oh, my God.

195
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:54,165
Also, you might be interested to know
that I have a Ph.D.

196
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,210
- Wow, you do?
- Yep. A pretty huge...

197
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:58,795
All right.

198
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:04,884
The sun will come out tomorrow

199
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:09,514
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow

200
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,308
There'll be sun

201
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:16,813
- Hey.
- Hey, Joey, honey, listen.

202
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,649
Thank you for talking to me yesterday
about that thing with my boss.

203
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,986
- That really meant a lot.
- Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know...

204
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,865
...that guy's not gonna be bothering you
about that baby thing anymore.

205
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,245
- What?
- Let's just say I took care of it.

206
00:14:32,413 --> 00:14:35,290
Ooh, let's say more.

207
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,626
Don't worry, don't worry.
I just told him, very nicely:

208
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:42,005
"You don't go buying people's babies,
so back off."

209
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,091
- What?
- What?

210
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,384
No, no, no.

211
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:49,679
Joey, he doesn't wanna buy my baby.
I made that up.

212
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,098
What? Why?

213
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,435
So that we would have something
to talk about so it wouldn't be awkward.

214
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,354
And you couldn't think of anything else?

215
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,233
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?

216
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,360
I can't believe you yelled at my boss.

217
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,779
I'm gonna lose my job.
What am I gonna do?

218
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,448
You could always sell your baby.

219
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:14,913
Joey, I cannot believe you brought
my boss into this. I'm gonna get fired.

220
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,041
- You lied to me.
- Well, she told me to.

221
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,544
Chandler has two copies of Annie.

222
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:39,646
Ah.

223
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,795
Oh, my God.

224
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,924
- Ross!
- Hello.

225
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,301
Ross, what are you doing?

226
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:16,391
Not touching myself, if that makes
anyone less uncomfortable.

227
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:23,356
Morning. You wanted to see me?

228
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,401
Please, come in. Have a seat.

229
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,739
- Okay, look, Mr. Zelner...
- Oh, I think it's best that I speak first.

230
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,116
Yeah.

231
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,914
I've asked Lee from human resources
to be here as a witness to our conversation.

232
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,582
Oh, God.

233
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:48,798
If I in any way implied
that I wanted to buy your baby...

234
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,219
...I am sorry. Okay?

235
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,973
Last week, when I asked you
when your due date was, uh...

236
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:02,520
...I certainly did not mean that
I felt that I was due your baby.

237
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,899
Yeah, I want to be very clear...

238
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,403
...that I understand that it's your baby...

239
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,449
...and it is not mine to purchase.

240
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,875
Well, as long as we are clear about that.

241
00:17:34,386 --> 00:17:35,428
Oh, there it is.

242
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,972
- That's not your regular dry cleaners.
- I know.

243
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,350
But that creep I went on that date with
goes there so I had to find a new one.

244
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,936
I also have to find a new video store,
a new bank...

245
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,355
...a new adult bookstore,
a new grocery store...

246
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,109
- What?
- A new grocery store.

247
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,864
The universe said I was gonna meet
a nice guy and that's what they gave me?

248
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:58,326
When I get up there,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

249
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,536
Don't worry, Phoebe,
you're gonna meet someone.

250
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:02,705
If I can meet a great guy,
so can you.

251
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,750
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

252
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,216
- Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
- Are you kidding?

253
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:17,095
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.

254
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:22,975
I'm gonna be over here
watching the dance of the clean shirts.

255
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:29,315
Oh, excuse me.
I think you, uh, dropped...

256
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,027
- Wow.
- What?

257
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,822
I'm sorry, it's just that
you're so incredibly beautiful.

258
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:40,118
Oh, yeah, well, I'm sorry about that too.
But what are you gonna do?

259
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,746
I hope you don't think I'm crazy,
but I feel like I was meant to pick this up.

260
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:48,042
- Do you believe in that kind of thing?
- A little. Heh.

261
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,128
Now you're talking.

262
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,465
- Would you like to go have a cup of coffee?
- I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.

263
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,594
Ooh. An ink stain.
Hey, can I watch how you get this out?

264
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:01,889
She must have left.

265
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,187
- Hi.
- So, what happened?

266
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:09,397
It's all gonna be okay.

267
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,232
They're just so happy
I'm not suing them...

268
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,318
...that they gave me one extra month
paid maternity leave.

269
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:17,530
So long as I understand that the money
should not be construed...

270
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:22,243
...as a down payment on this
or any other child that I may bear.

271
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,871
Wow. Ralph Lauren
is going out of their way...

272
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,832
...to show that they're not
in the baby-buying business.

273
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,669
- Chandler, can you give us a minute?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

274
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:34,172
- You're kicking me out of my living room?
- Yeah.

275
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:37,383
I'll be in there.

276
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:46,309
Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you.
I was just trying to make things...

277
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,853
I know. I know.

278
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,355
But it kind of worked.

279
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,191
I mean, you know,
I don't know about you...

280
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,693
...but I haven't thought about our thing
since all this.

281
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,070
Yeah, you're right.

282
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:02,617
Yeah. It's kind of been like us again,
a little bit.

283
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,037
- Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
- Me too.

284
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,790
I mean, I haven't thought at all
about how I put myself out there...

285
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,377
...and said that stuff and how
you didn't feel the same way about me...

286
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:17,924
...and how it was really awkward.

287
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,892
My gynecologist tried to kill me.

288
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:38,736
Item J437-A.

289
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:41,864
Color: Winterberry.

290
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,166
Hi, um, listen.
Come here. Come...

291
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:55,044
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.

292
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,922
I'm really, really sorry. It's just...

293
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,802
Listen, Ross, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.

294
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:06,013
- You do?
- Yeah. You still have feelings for me.

295
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:10,268
And to be honest,
I still have feelings for you too...

296
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,895
...and I wish we could work out, Ross,
but we can't.

297
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:17,316
It's too complicated with you
and Rachel and the baby. I just...

298
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,444
It just wasn't meant to be.

299
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,115
Oh, God. You're right.

300
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:29,537
- Ross, we have to be strong.
- Mm.

301
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:34,000
Okay, I'm gonna go.

302
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:39,797
Can I? To remember you?

303
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,761
No.
