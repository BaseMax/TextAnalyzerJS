1
00:00:05,296 --> 00:00:10,259
Oh, my God, you cleaned!
Look at these floors!

2
00:00:10,427 --> 00:00:11,593
You did the windows!

3
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,388
I have been begging for months
and you did, you cleaned!

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:19,685
- And nagging works!
- No, uh, I didn't actually do this.

5
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:22,479
Oh, no. Was I cleaning
in my sleep again?

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,357
No, it wasn't you.

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:28,277
- Well, then, who?
- I got a maid. Yay!

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,157
Oh, well, I hope by "maid,"
you mean "mistress"...

9
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,409
...because if some other woman
was cleaning...

10
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:39,455
Now, honey, I know you don't like
to relinquish control.

11
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,915
"Relinquish" is just
a fancy word for "lose."

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,168
Look, she's really nice, okay?

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:49,089
And she mentioned that she adored
the way that you arranged the sponges.

14
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:51,800
Did she really say that?

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,137
Yes, I distinctly remember
because I thought it was a joke.

16
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:59,433
- Now, just give her a chance, okay?
- Fine, I can do it.

17
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:01,727
Whoo.

18
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,315
- What's the matter?
- Usually when I'm anxious, I clean.

19
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,778
Whose cell phone is that?
It's just so annoying.

20
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,489
- Everywhere you go.
- I think it's coming from your bag.

21
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:01,286
I never get calls!

22
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,539
Hello?

23
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:09,920
Hi, it's Eric, from the Halloween
party. Ursula's fiancé.

24
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:13,674
Oh, my God, Eric, hi!
Wait, how'd you get this number?

25
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:17,136
I have a friend who's a cop,
and he got it.

26
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:21,890
Wow. What an incredible violation
and wonderful surprise!

27
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,644
I just... I thought you should know
I broke up with Ursula.

28
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,647
Oh, you did?
He did it, he did it!

29
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,816
- Wow, what did he do?
- Shh! I'm talking.

30
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,528
Anyway, I was wondering...

31
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:39,491
...if you were the sort of person
who eats lunch?

32
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,119
Are you asking me out?

33
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:46,248
Because it'd be weird since you
just broke up with my sister.

34
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,918
Yeah, um, okay.

35
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,879
I'm sorry. Bye.

36
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,674
No, wait! I was just saying that
so you'd think I was a good person.

37
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,178
Fight for me!

38
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:03,140
Uh, I won't take no for an answer.

39
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,893
Not great, we can work on it at lunch.

40
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,188
Okay, um, I can be at your apartment
in two hours.

41
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,024
Great. Uh, how do you know where I live?

42
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,151
I've got friends too.

43
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:16,195
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

44
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,489
Oh, my God, I'm going out with Eric!

45
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:24,286
Oh, this day is gonna be much better
than I thought it was gonna be. Heh.

46
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,371
Oh, Ross, I can't make lunch.

47
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,045
So apparently I'm available
for lunch.

48
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,923
Can't, I'm busy. I'm apartment hunting.

49
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,633
You're moving?

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,761
I can't live with Joey
once the baby comes.

51
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:45,098
I don't want my child's first words
to be, "How you doing?"

52
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:49,061
So does Joey know you're moving?

53
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,772
I haven't discussed it,
but he's gonna be relieved.

54
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,815
Last week he brought this girl over...

55
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,860
...and I started talking to her
about morning sickness.

56
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:59,571
Then I showed her pictures
from my pregnancy book.

57
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,115
- That's not really porn.
- Not so much.

58
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,702
You know what?
If you're looking for a place...

59
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,748
...I heard in the elevator this morning
that a woman in my building died.

60
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:15,087
Oh, my God. Was she old?
Does she have a view?

61
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,882
Well I don't know.
But how great would that be, huh?

62
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,509
You living in my building?

63
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:24,972
I could take care of the baby,
I could come over whenever I want...

64
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,723
...with your permission.

65
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,934
- That really would be great.
- Yeah.

66
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,811
Well, can we see it?

67
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,731
Oh, maybe we shouldn't. If she
just died this morning. Out of respect.

68
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,277
Yeah. No. No, you're right.

69
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,282
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

70
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:54,793
- Yes?
- Hi. I'm Ross Geller.

71
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,712
I live in the building.

72
00:04:56,879 --> 00:05:01,008
And I'm Rachel,
an admirer of the building.

73
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:08,056
I heard about Mrs. Verhoeven passing
away, and I am so sorry for your loss.

74
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,475
- She didn't pass away.
- What?

75
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:14,855
- My mother's still alive.
- Oh, thank God!

76
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,234
It looked like we were gonna lose her
this morning...

77
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,029
- ...but she's a tough old bird.
- Aww.

78
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,822
Are you close with her?

79
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:25,615
Of course. Heh.

80
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,577
Uh, yeah.
She and I would talk all the time...

81
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:32,080
...in the laundry room.

82
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,915
You speak Dutch?

83
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,051
You know, I would,
but it's just too painful.

84
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,139
So she's really not dead.

85
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,642
- No. She's hanging in there.
- Mm.

86
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:57,647
Do you think...? Could you tell me, is she
hanging in in a one-bedroom or a two?

87
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:06,406
Mrs. Bing, this tile cleaner is incredible.
Where did you get it?

88
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,868
Oh, well, um, I make it myself.

89
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:14,706
It's two parts ammonia and one part
lemon juice. The secret ingredient is...

90
00:06:15,249 --> 00:06:17,417
You know what? We just met.

91
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:22,672
Okay. Uh, I'm gonna get the clothes
from the laundry room now...

92
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,550
...and when I come back,
I'll clean behind the fridge.

93
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,386
I love her.

94
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,181
I'll be back in a minute.

95
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:33,600
Okay.

96
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,313
- See? I told you.
- She stole my jeans!

97
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:41,900
What?

98
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,862
I have been looking for them all week
and she is wearing them.

99
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,572
So she stole your pants...

100
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,617
...and then she came back
and wore them in front of you?

101
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:54,204
Don't you see? It's the perfect crime.

102
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,083
She must have been
planning this for years.

103
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,501
I will prove it to you.

104
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,670
About a week ago,
I was wearing those jeans.

105
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,840
I dropped a pen in my lap
and it left an ink stain on the crotch.

106
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:09,428
When she comes back,
I will find it and show you that stain!

107
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,516
Is it possible the company
that sold the jeans...

108
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:16,852
...made more than just the one pair?

109
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:19,187
I guess.

110
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,482
So shouldn't we give her
the benefit of the doubt before we go...

111
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,609
...snooping around her crotch?

112
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:30,282
Fine. I'm just glad I didn't give
her my secret ingredient.

113
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,909
Heh. Out of curiosity,
what is your secret ingredient?

114
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,245
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

115
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:43,420
- Hi.
- Come in. I'm so glad you're here.

116
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,088
Yeah. Me too.

117
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,799
Not in the shaky,
angry way you are, though.

118
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,552
Sorry. I just saw Ursula.

119
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,138
- I had to get the engagement ring back.
- Ugh.

120
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,433
Just seeing her brought it all back.

121
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,061
All the lies, the way she used me.

122
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:04,691
I just... I get so angry,
just looking at her...

123
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:12,157
- Face.
- Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:17,871
I'm sorry. It's just, when I look at you...

125
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,540
...I see her.

126
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:25,754
And when I see her,
I get a little bit angry.

127
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,717
- Maybe this is too weird.
- No, wait.

128
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:32,928
There's only a problem...

129
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,346
...when I look at you.

130
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,225
I got it. I got it.

131
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,978
No, don't tear out your eyes!

132
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:46,441
- I was just gonna take out my lenses.
- Oh, yeah. Try that.

133
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,112
So is that better?

134
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,822
Not really.

135
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,494
You... Ugh. You're blurry.

136
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,664
But you still look like Ursula.
You're "Blursula."

137
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,670
Okay, wait. Maybe...

138
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:11,383
If I just don't look at you for a while.

139
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,471
See? It works.
I'm not angry at all anymore.

140
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:19,015
This is a great date!

141
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:23,019
Look, Eric, turn around.

142
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:29,442
Look, I like you, but it shouldn't
be this hard. It's our first date.

143
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:33,572
First dates are supposed to be
about excitement and electricity.

144
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,741
And "Ooh, he touched my hand,
did he mean touch my hand?"

145
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,827
And, you know, first kisses, and...

146
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,914
...second kisses.

147
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,170
Thanks for the coffee, or, uh, ahem:

148
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,391
Yeah, we're done.

149
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,440
"Ezel"? Ezel...

150
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,900
Hey, Ross. Listen.

151
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,404
You wanna go see
that new IMAX movie on tide pools?

152
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,032
- Really?
- No, ha, ha.

153
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,453
But I got Knicks tickets
for you, me, and Chandler.

154
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:24,497
- Sweet!
- All right, finish your coffee. Let's go.

155
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,333
I have to stop by my place.

156
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,004
To tape the game? You do this every
time. You're not gonna be on TV!

157
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,050
No, no, I have to see
if this apartment became available.

158
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,345
- You're switching apartments?
- Not for me, it's for Rachel.

159
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,973
- Rachel has an apartment.
- When the baby comes, she's gonna move.

160
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,142
- She is?
- Yeah.

161
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,354
You didn't expect her
to live there with a baby, did you?

162
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:49,898
I guess I didn't really think about it.

163
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,069
Ezel.

164
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:59,324
Hey, Gunther, you're an ezel. Huh.

165
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:04,245
Damn it.

166
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:11,252
- Nice jeans.
- Oh, thanks.

167
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:15,423
- I like your top.
- Oh. You're not getting it.

168
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:26,768
- What happened?
- Oh. I fell asleep.

169
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,064
I was thinking about taking
my lunch break.

170
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:35,276
Will you do the top of the cabinets?
That'll really work up your appetite.

171
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:38,154
All right.

172
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,971
Hello.

173
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:05,807
What's going on?

174
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,519
I'm sorry. I've never had a maid
before. Is this not okay?

175
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,444
- Hey.
- Hey.

176
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,823
- How was the game?
- Uh, it was okay. I ate way too much.

177
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,408
- Mm.
- Ooh.

178
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:30,248
So, um, I was talking to Ross and he said
you were looking for a new place?

179
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:36,087
Oh, yeah. Hopefully across the street.
If certain Dutch people would just let go.

180
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,632
I was kind of hoping you'd stay.

181
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:44,345
But Joey, I have to go.
There's no room for a baby here.

182
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:48,516
No room? It's a baby.
It's, like, this big.

183
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,854
You could put it over here.

184
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:56,858
Or we could put it right here.
Aw! Cute, right?

185
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,612
Or over here.
You wouldn't even notice it.

186
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,864
"Where's the baby?"
"Oh, it's right over..."

187
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,578
Honey, it's not just a matter
of where you put it.

188
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:12,165
A baby changes everything.
They cry all the time.

189
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,375
Imagine bringing home some girl...

190
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,295
...and trying to score
when there's a screaming baby.

191
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,049
I could use a challenge.
It's getting pretty easy.

192
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:24,886
It's so sweet that you want me
to stay, but I can't do that to you.

193
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,096
I mean, it would disrupt your entire life.

194
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,225
It's just...

195
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,812
I love living with you so much.

196
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:38,316
- I wish things didn't have to change.
- I know.

197
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,735
You know, I blame Ross for this.

198
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:45,031
- I do too, a little bit.
- Yeah.

199
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,951
I'm gonna miss you.

200
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,745
You're the hottest roommate
I ever had.

201
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,126
Mm. Ooh.

202
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:01,172
Oh, no, I have to go.
Ugh, I have a massage appointment.

203
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:04,592
No, stay here. We'll keep doing this.
I'll pay you.

204
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:07,720
No, I've gotten in trouble
for that before.

205
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:11,766
- I'll see you later?
- Absolutely.

206
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,020
I love the way you kiss.

207
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,815
Really? That's the thing I'm worst at!

208
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,859
Heh, you'll see.

209
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:28,700
- Hey.
- Hey! Um...

210
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,703
- I think Brenda needs a raise.
- How come?

211
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,706
Because I put my head
between her legs.

212
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,876
- To see her pants?
- They're my pants!

213
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,961
Are you sure? Did you see the stain?

214
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:43,131
No. I was getting into position,
and everything went dark.

215
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,303
God, she is not stealing from us, okay?
Will you let this go?

216
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,013
Fine.

217
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,813
- She's wearing my bra!
- Oh, dear God.

218
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,275
My pink flowered bra!
I recognize the strap!

219
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,611
And yet you don't recognize
that you're crazy?

220
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,404
Here's the plan, okay?

221
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,574
I'm going to leave,
and you're gonna look at Brenda's bra.

222
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,619
Here's another plan. No.

223
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,080
I would do it, but she thinks
I'm attracted to her.

224
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,917
- Why?
- Did you not hear where my head was?

225
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:23,546
Come on! We're a team.
We're in this together.

226
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:27,175
I fear a jury will see it the same way.

227
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:32,138
Do this for me. I catch you looking
at women's breasts all the time.

228
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,681
You see that?

229
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,267
Do you see this? Unh...

230
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,189
All right. Yes, okay. I get your point.

231
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:44,275
But if it's not her bra,
will you just let the woman clean?

232
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,110
Yes. Absolutely. Okay?

233
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:49,280
You'll know it's mine because on
the right cup, the lacy part...

234
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:51,532
...there's very a noticeable rip.

235
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,743
You need new clothes.

236
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,752
- Hi. How is she?
- It's not looking good.

237
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,588
Oh? Oh. Aw.

238
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:10,093
Well, I, uh, brought her some bloemen.

239
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,429
That's so sweet.

240
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:17,266
Would you like to say goodbye?
I'm sure it would mean a lot to her.

241
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:20,812
Oh, I don't know that it would. Heh.

242
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,857
- Well, her memory is pretty much gone.
- All right, then.

243
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,035
- Hey!
- Welcome back.

244
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:40,915
- Should we pick up from where we left off?
- I don't know.

245
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,792
I'm still tired from this afternoon.

246
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,253
- Why?
- Uh, the sex.

247
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,338
- What sex?
- Our sex.

248
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,881
We didn't have sex.

249
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,758
Well if I didn't have sex with you...

250
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:53,720
...I had sex with somebody
that looked an awful lot like...

251
00:16:55,889 --> 00:17:00,268
- Ew. Ew. Ew, ew!
- No, no, no, no!

252
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:04,355
- You had sex with Ursula?
- A little bit.

253
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,608
She walked in, I thought she was you
and I kissed her and...

254
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,736
You didn't notice different clothes?

255
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:13,489
- I was just so excited to see you.
- Aw.

256
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,950
Ew! Ew! Ew!

257
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,745
Ugh! You know what? This is too weird.

258
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:21,998
No. I don't wanna lose you.
It's like I was saying to Ursula...

259
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,876
...when I was making love to her
and thought she was you...

260
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,919
Yeah. It's too weird.

261
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,256
So I guess this is it.

262
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,051
Yeah.

263
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,763
Maybe it's for the best.

264
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,475
- You smell just like her.
- Yeah, so do you.

265
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:03,706
- What are you doing?
- I'm leaning.

266
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:06,667
This is where I lean.

267
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,670
Okay.

268
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,300
- Brenda, a bee!
- What?

269
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,219
Yes, it's flown into your blouse.

270
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,639
You better undo your buttons
lest it sting you.

271
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,311
- I think I know what's going on here.
- You do?

272
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:28,940
Look, I know it must be hard
that your wife is a lesbian...

273
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,695
...but it's wrong. You're married.

274
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:38,116
- I totally understand.
- Okay, good. Ha-ha-ha.

275
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,035
Could I just see your bra?

276
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,873
Hi.

277
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,920
- Where'd you get those jeans?
- You gave them to me.

278
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,423
- No, I didn't!
- All right, I took them.

279
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,803
I figured it was okay,
you've got an ink stain on the crotch.

280
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:02,849
- Oh, no! Did you take my bra too?
- What bra?

281
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:06,477
- The pink one with the flowers.
- You mean the one you're wearing?

282
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,234
I quit!

283
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,320
Sounds about right.

284
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,079
- What is this?
- Hey.

285
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,248
Uh, this is just to give you an idea.

286
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,877
We can put screens here
so the baby has privacy...

287
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:34,255
...and maybe a mobile,
you know, over the crib...

288
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:37,592
...and, uh, here's a baby monitor which,
until the baby comes...

289
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,012
...we can use as walkie-talkies. Eh?

290
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,389
You're so sweet!

291
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:48,019
Oh, my God!
And you gave the baby Hugsy!

292
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,898
Uh...

293
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:58,112
That's really just to show
where the baby would go.

294
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,948
Why don't I hold on to him
so there's no confusion?

295
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:09,457
Joey, the baby is gonna be crying.
It's gonna be loud.

296
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,210
- I'm loud.
- It's gonna be up all night.

297
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,712
- I'm up all night.
- It's gonna poop.

298
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,923
Hello?

299
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,384
What about the women
you wanna bring home?

300
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:24,263
Look, if I'm bringing home a woman
who can't stand being around a baby...

301
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,974
...then maybe I don't wanna
be with that woman.

302
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:31,187
Or maybe we'll do it
in the bathroom of the club!

303
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,815
- Joey, are you sure?
- Yeah.

304
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:38,986
Look, I know sometimes
it'll be hard, okay...

305
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,616
...but it'll also be really,
really great.

306
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:46,577
Please, Rachel,
I really want you to stay.

307
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,416
- I want me to stay too. Thank you.
- Aw.

308
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,464
Joey, look at this crib! It's so cute!

309
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,675
I know. I found it on the street.

310
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,343
Are you...? Really?

311
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,887
- This is in such good condition.
- Yeah.

312
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,473
Wow. Whoa, what's under the cover?

313
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,141
- I don't know.
- It's moving.

314
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,685
- Ew.
- Still...

315
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:13,187
- Aah! It's got a tail! Get it out!
- Oh, aah! Okay!

316
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:25,950
Well, the old lady died.
And how do I know?

317
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,495
Because her dying wish
was for one last kiss.

318
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,751
But I don't care because
you got the apartment. Yes!

319
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,587
Ew, yeah.

320
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,966
Um, I think I'm gonna stay here.

321
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,260
Isn't that great?

322
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,973
Ezels!
