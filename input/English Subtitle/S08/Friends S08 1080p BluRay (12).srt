1
00:00:03,586 --> 00:00:06,171
Hey, I got you a present!

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:08,799
Oh, my goodness, where did you hide it?

3
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:12,678
I got it for your wedding, I ordered it
weeks ago and it finally got here!

4
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:15,472
Pheebs, you didn't have to get us
anything for our...

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,600
I love it! It's huge! Let's open it! Open it!

6
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:25,274
- It's a Ms. Pac-Man machine!
- Oh, my God!

7
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:27,526
I didn't know where to put it so I left.

8
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,487
- We can put it in the guest bedroom.
- Yeah, okay.

9
00:00:35,577 --> 00:00:38,495
- I kind of like it here.
- Do you really like it?

10
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:42,291
Are you kidding? I practically spent my
entire childhood at the arcade.

11
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:46,170
- This was, like, my second favorite game.
- What was your first?

12
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:50,382
- I don't really remember the name of it.
- Well, what did it do?

13
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:55,304
Well, you'd put a quarter in,
pull some handles and win a candy bar.

14
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,473
A vending machine?

15
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,601
Hey, don't feel bad for me.
I won every time!

16
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,810
Hey! I'm so glad you guys are here.

17
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,563
I've been dying to tell someone what
happened in the paleontology department.

18
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:49,775
Do you think he saw us,
or can we still slip out?

19
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,863
Professor Newman, the head
of the department, is retiring, so...

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:02:00,202
- They made you head of the department!
- No, I get to teach his advanced class!

21
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:04,373
Why didn't I get head
of the department?

22
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,334
- Oh, hey, Rach, listen, um...
- Yeah.

23
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,003
I got a big date.
Do you know a good restaurant?

24
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:15,259
Uh, Paul's Cafe. It's got great food
and it's really romantic.

25
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,844
Ooh. Great, thanks.

26
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,556
And then after, you could take her
to the Four Seasons for drinks.

27
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,643
Or go downtown
and listen to some jazz.

28
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:27,271
Or dancing. Oh, take her dancing!

29
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:31,066
You sure are naming a lot of ways
to postpone sex, I'll tell you.

30
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:36,280
Agh, I miss dating. Getting dressed up,
going to a fancy restaurant.

31
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:41,410
I'm not gonna be able to do that
for so long. And it's so much fun.

32
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,248
Not that sitting at home worrying about
giving birth to a 16-pound baby is not fun.

33
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,503
Hey, you know what?
Why don't I take you out?

34
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:55,007
What? You don't want to go on
a date with a pregnant lady.

35
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:58,051
Yes, I do. We're gonna go out,
we're gonna have a good time.

36
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,431
I'll take your mind off of childbirth,
and C-sections...

37
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,100
...and giant baby heads stretching out...

38
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,768
Okay, I'll go with you. I'll go.

39
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,438
- It will be fun.
- All right. Okay.

40
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,565
No, no! Yes!

41
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,902
Aw, would you look at that, Monica?

42
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:17,112
I knocked off all your top scores.
How sad.

43
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,907
Okay, I'm next.

44
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:23,410
No, don't start another game.
I'm next! Phoebe?

45
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
over all the winning.

46
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:31,210
- Chandler! Phoebe's hogging the game.
- Who cares? It's a stupid game.

47
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:34,338
Oh, you only think it's stupid
because you suck at it.

48
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:37,799
I don't suck. It sucks.

49
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,760
You suck.

50
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,140
If this game is gonna
cause problems between you...

51
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:49,144
...maybe I should keep it.
- No, I love it. It is a great present.

52
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:53,649
In fact, why don't you go home
and wait for the "Thank You" card?

53
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:57,152
- Why do you want to play so badly?
- Yeah, it's not like it spits out...

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,154
...a Clark Bar after every game.

55
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,909
Okay. Phoebe, that's it.
Out of the chair. Come on. Out of the chair.

56
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,828
Phoebe!

57
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,001
Joey, could you get that?

58
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,631
Ugh, Joey...

59
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:28,016
What? I thought you were in your room.

60
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,687
No, I'm picking you up for our date.
These are for you.

61
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:36,900
Oh, lilies. They're my favorite.
Thank you.

62
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,860
And a brownie.

63
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,615
Well, half a brownie.

64
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,909
Actually, it's just a bag.

65
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:49,705
It's a long walk from the flower shop
and I was starting to feel faint, so...

66
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,667
Oh, man, this is so great!

67
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:56,295
I actually feel like
I'm going on a real date.

68
00:04:56,462 --> 00:05:01,758
With a hint of morning sickness and I'm
wearing underwear that goes up to about...

69
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,135
...there.

70
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:06,513
Hey, come on. This is a real date. Uh...

71
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,807
So, nice place you got here.

72
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,478
Foosball, huh? Pizza box.

73
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:17,399
Oh, a subscription to Playboy.
My kind of woman.

74
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,568
Actually, that's my roommate's.

75
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,530
I'd like to meet him.
He sounds like a standup guy.

76
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,824
But he's very protective of me...

77
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,909
...so you'd better watch yourself.
- Ah.

78
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,954
Hey, so, this roommate of yours,
is he good-looking?

79
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:33,248
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, yeah.

80
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:36,251
- Must be tough to keep your hands off him.
- Ha, ha.

81
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,628
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure he's gay.

82
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:42,382
No! No, he's not! Why are you trying
to ruin the game?

83
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,930
Which brings us back, of course,
to Greely's Theory of Dominance.

84
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,516
That's it for today.

85
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:55,187
Oh, uh, does anyone know
where the Freeman Building is?

86
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,689
Yeah, it's the new building on Avenue A.

87
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,316
What? That's across town.

88
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,943
I'm supposed to teach a seminar there
in 10 minutes.

89
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,321
Ooh, dude, that's not gonna happen.

90
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,534
Move it. Move it. Move it!

91
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,953
Hey! I'm the teacher!

92
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,219
Hello.

93
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,058
Sorry I'm a little late. Uh...

94
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,643
Whoa, a lot late.

95
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,856
Uh, well, let me start by,
uh, introducing myself.

96
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,650
I'm, uh, Professor Geller.

97
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,987
So to sum up...

98
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,990
...I'm Professor Geller. Good job today.

99
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,621
Now, the filet mignon,
what comes with that?

100
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,415
A side of steamed vegetables.

101
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,834
Mm.

102
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,628
Instead of the vegetables...

103
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:06,341
...is there any way that I could
substitute the, um...

104
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,427
...three-pound lobster?

105
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,347
You know what? Bring her both.

106
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,182
And I'll have the same.

107
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,854
Wow, this is shaping up
to be a pretty good date.

108
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:21,398
Oh, I almost forgot.
I didn't pay you the rent.

109
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,776
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
no roommate stuff. We're on a date.

110
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:29,865
Okay. Wow, so I get to see what
Joey Tribbiani is like on a date.

111
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,116
Do you have any moves?

112
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:35,537
No, I'm just myself,
and if they don't like me for...

113
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,125
I'm sorry, I couldn't even
get through that.

114
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,880
I knew it. Come on, tell me your moves.

115
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:46,548
Uh, all right. Um...

116
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,341
Well...

117
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:53,013
I start by having a bottle of wine
sent to my table from a fan.

118
00:07:53,181 --> 00:07:56,725
Oh, my God. And that works?

119
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,853
It does when you combine it with,
"This is embarrassing.

120
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,230
I just want to have a normal life."

121
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,941
- Aw, you poor little famous man.
- Mm-hm.

122
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:07,944
Oh, okay, how about this one?

123
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:12,032
I was gonna wait until the end
of the night to kiss you...

124
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,494
...but you're just so beautiful,
I don't think I can.

125
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,664
Oh, my God! Ha.

126
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:25,128
Wow, that was fantastic!
I almost leaned in. I really almost did.

127
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,506
All right, so tell me one of your moves.

128
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,716
All right. Ahem.

129
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:34,888
So where'd you grow up?

130
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,516
That's your move?

131
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:40,602
Boy, Rach, you're lucky you're hot.

132
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,773
- Come on, just answer the question.
- Ugh. Queens.

133
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,359
And so were you close to your parents?

134
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:51,071
- With my mom. Not so much my dad.
- Why not?

135
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:54,074
I don't know. I guess there's just
always been this distance.

136
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:57,869
I mean, we both try to pretend
it's not there, but it is.

137
00:08:58,246 --> 00:08:59,663
Mm.

138
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,331
It's gotta be rough.

139
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:05,335
It is. Yeah, it's really tough.
You know, sometimes I think...

140
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:07,546
Wow!

141
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,425
- Nice move!
- Uh-huh.

142
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,346
- "Where'd you grow up?" So simple.
- Thank you.

143
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,266
Ha, ha. Now, excuse me.
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

144
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:27,065
- And now you're watching me walk away.
- Yes, I am! Again, so simple.

145
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,236
Hey.

146
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:35,949
- You're not gonna believe what I did today.
- Clearly wasn't showering or shaving.

147
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:39,869
I got good. I played this game all day,
and now I rule at it.

148
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:42,831
They should change the name
of it to "Ms. Chandler."

149
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,501
Although, I hope they don't.

150
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,838
You stayed home all day
and played Ms. Pac-Man...

151
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,007
...while I went off to work
like some chump?

152
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:57,887
Uh-huh. I got the top ten scores.
I erased Phoebe off the board. High-five!

153
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,558
What is the matter with your hand?

154
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:07,188
I been playing for eight hours.

155
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:10,275
It'll loosen up. Come on,
check out the scores.

156
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,903
And also, look at the initials.
They're dirty words.

157
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:18,366
- Chandler, why would you do that?
- Because it's awesome.

158
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:20,118
You think this is clever?

159
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:24,539
They only give you three letters,
so after A-S-S, it is a challenge.

160
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:29,878
- This one's not dirty.
- It is when you put it together with that one.

161
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,713
Oh. Heh.

162
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:35,300
If you don't clear this off,
you won't get one of those from me.

163
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,846
Ben's coming over here tomorrow.
This can't be there.

164
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,933
- He won't know what they mean.
- He's 7, not stupid.

165
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:48,688
- Have you talked to him lately?
- Look, I'm gonna unplug it.

166
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,940
No, no! I'll have nothing
to show for my day.

167
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:52,400
It'll be like I was at work.

168
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:54,778
No!

169
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,947
Hey, look! It's still there!

170
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:01,493
This thing must have some kind
of primitive ROM chip in it or something!

171
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,746
- You gotta beat your scores.
- With the claw?

172
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,625
Fine, I'll do it.
We gotta get this off the screen.

173
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,836
Carol's still upset that
you taught him "Pull my finger."

174
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:16,508
Pull my finger. My hand is messed up!

175
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:24,766
- I am not gonna answer that.
- Oh, come on. Just pick one.

176
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,435
Between Monica, Phoebe,
Chandler and Ross...

177
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:31,147
...if you had to... If you had to,
who would you punch?

178
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:34,984
No one. They're my friends.
I wouldn't punch any of them.

179
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,278
Chandler?

180
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,155
Yeah, but I don't know why.

181
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,327
- I'm having a wonderful time!
- Me too.

182
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,787
Hey, Rach, can I just say...

183
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:48,540
...I think this is the best date I ever had.
- I know!

184
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,419
I've never laughed so hard. Did you
see the wine come out my nose?

185
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:56,047
Yes. Joey, I think everybody saw
the wine come out of your nose.

186
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:01,052
I gotta say, I never knew I could enjoy
the non-sex part of a date so much.

187
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:05,640
That's because you have never
been on a date with me before.

188
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,308
Huh.

189
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,811
All right. Now don't judge me.

190
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:13,064
I normally wait till my date leaves,
but you live here.

191
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,441
I'm ripping into the swan.

192
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,360
Okay, well then, you don't judge me.

193
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:21,197
I'm gonna suck on the cellophane
from the brownie I had before.

194
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,247
Mm. Mm.

195
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:34,711
So tell me, what are Joey Tribbiani's
end-of-the-night moves?

196
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:40,967
Uh, well, if I want the girl to kiss me...

197
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:44,429
...first thing I do is make my lips
look irresistible.

198
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,347
How do you do it?

199
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:50,018
Now you can't tell anyone, but, uh...

200
00:12:50,311 --> 00:12:52,479
...I put on shiny lip balm.

201
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:58,818
- Oh, my God.
- Like a moth to a flame, I'm telling you.

202
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,448
- Okay, all right, so now you go.
- No, I don't want to tell you.

203
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:05,450
- Why not?
- It's embarrassing.

204
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,286
More embarrassing than
shiny raspberry lip balm?

205
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,041
I didn't say raspberry before, did I?

206
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:17,212
- Just tell me, Rach. Just tell me.
- Ha, ha.

207
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:19,255
Okay. All right, stand up.

208
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,178
Well, when we're at the door...

209
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:30,433
...I lightly press my lips against his.

210
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,813
Then move into his body,
just for a second.

211
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,565
And then I make this sound:

212
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,527
Mmm.

213
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,366
I know it doesn't sound like anything,
but it works.

214
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:49,577
Oh, yeah. That would work, yeah.

215
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,207
All right, I gotta go to bed.
I had such a wonderful time.

216
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,084
- Mwah.
- Oh, yeah.

217
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,216
Me too.

218
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:17,105
You were 50 minutes late to the class?
Did you crawl there?

219
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,400
No, I ran, okay? It's really far.

220
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,612
When did people stop understanding
"Get the hell out of my way"?

221
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,198
Why didn't you take a cab?

222
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:32,495
Ugh. Between the traffic and one-way
streets, it'd take me twice as long.

223
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:37,166
Besides, I teach the class three times
a week. Who am I, Rockefeller?

224
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,545
You're not gonna be able
to keep doing this.

225
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,716
I have to. If I don't,
they'll take the class away from me.

226
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:47,677
And I already put it
in my family newsletter.

227
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:52,265
- Your what?
- You've seen it, The Geller Yeller.

228
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,769
Right. Wow.

229
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:02,358
Besides, I figured out a faster route.
I'm sure I can make it this time.

230
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:06,487
I just can't be afraid
to get a little bit hit by cars.

231
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,618
- Hey.
- Hi!

232
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,746
Hey, remember, um, last night
when we were talking about Cujo?

233
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:18,249
Oh, yeah, I can't believe you haven't
seen Cujo. What is wrong with you?

234
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,418
Relax, it's not like it's Citizen Kane.

235
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,962
Have you ever tried to sit through
Citizen Kane?

236
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,965
Yeah, I know. It's really boring.

237
00:15:26,133 --> 00:15:28,384
- But it's a big deal.
- Yeah.

238
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:31,721
Anyway, I was thinking
about renting Cujo sometime.

239
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,349
Well, yeah, all right.
Let's do it tonight.

240
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:38,102
- Don't you have that big date tonight?
- Oh, right.

241
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,940
- Hey, Joey, can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

242
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,859
After our date last night,
did you feel a little weird?

243
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:49,781
Oh, my God. You did too?
It freaked me out. What was that?

244
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,950
I don't know.

245
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:55,453
I'm kind of thinking it was the lobster.

246
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,542
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the lobster.

247
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,338
- I was up sick all night.
- Yeah, me too. All night.

248
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,049
Really? How come
we didn't cross paths?

249
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,677
Yeah, well, that's because, uh...

250
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,845
...I stayed in my room.

251
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,475
Yeah, you don't want to look
in my hamper.

252
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,982
Okay, I got that.

253
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,985
I'll escape there.
I'll come back here.

254
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,570
All right. Come on, Ms. Pac-Man...

255
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,242
Well, you're just a little bitch, aren't you?

256
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:39,747
Hey, you guys?

257
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:43,710
I'm sorry that I was
hogging the game before.

258
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:49,007
Oh, my God, your friends
have some unfortunate initials.

259
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,343
- They're all Chandler.
- Chandler sucks.

260
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:56,014
- He couldn't have gotten this good.
- I did.

261
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:58,641
- But it came at a price.
- Ugh.

262
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,228
Ben's coming, and he can't see this.

263
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,898
Come on, by age 7,
kids have already seen orgies.

264
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,571
Was it just me?

265
00:17:21,248 --> 00:17:23,916
Yes, I made it! I'm on time!

266
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,337
Agh.

267
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:32,341
Okay, why don't we all, uh...

268
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,680
...open our books to page 23...

269
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:39,348
...where...

270
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,936
...where you will see a, uh...

271
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,692
...a bunch of, uh, red spots.

272
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:55,990
Okay, why don't, uh,
you all start to read, while I...

273
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,669
Hey, are you all right?
You seem a little distracted.

274
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:12,340
No, no, I'm fine. It's just...

275
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,843
Hey, can I ask you something?

276
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:19,055
Have you ever looked at someone
that you've known for a while...

277
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,517
...and suddenly seen them
in a different way?

278
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,769
You mean like from behind?

279
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,693
Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly it.

280
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:33,986
You know what?

281
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,490
One time I saw this guy from behind,
and he seemed totally normal.

282
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,118
And then he turned around
and it was Stephen Baldwin!

283
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:46,290
Ooh, yeah. So you know
exactly what I'm talking about.

284
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,918
- Totally! Wow.
- Ha-ha-ha.

285
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,840
- Would you excuse me for a sec?
- Yeah, sure.

286
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,891
Eh.

287
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,812
- God, Phoebe! You're on fire!
- I know!

288
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,648
- You can do it!
- Don't touch me!

289
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,150
Don't touch her!

290
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,694
All right, go left! Go right! Go right!

291
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,028
I can't! I can't!

292
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,991
No! You son of a...

293
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,589
Phoebe!

294
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:38,176
Oh, hi, Ben.
No, don't look at the machine!

295
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,646
Aah! God! Thank God you're home.

296
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:53,107
- I'm watching Cujo.
- Alone?

297
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:57,612
- Yes! What is wrong with this dog?
- Did you get to the part...

298
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:01,199
...where they're in the car and Cujo's
throwing himself at the windshield?

299
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,994
No. No! Seriously,
what's wrong with the dog?

300
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,039
What are you doing home?
What happened to your date?

301
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,583
Oh, uh, it didn't work out.

302
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,169
Want to watch
the rest of the movie with me?

303
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:15,796
Oh, uh, okay. Yeah.

304
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,299
I never thought I'd say this
about a movie...

305
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:20,593
...but I hope this dog dies.

306
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,765
What are you doing over there?
Come sit here. Protect me.

307
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:29,101
Oh. Sure, yeah. Why not?

308
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,191
Okay.

309
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:43,658
- That's him, that's him! That's Cujo!
- All right, I know.

310
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:47,286
It's gonna be okay.

311
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:51,582
Oh, my God. What's he gonna do now?
I can't watch.

312
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,880
Ugh, seriously, how can you watch this?
Aren't you scared?

313
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,011
Terrified.

314
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:19,360
So is everybody here?
I got here a little early, myself.

315
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,528
Let us begin.

316
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:26,909
Now, the hadrosaurids have been
unearthed in two main locations.

317
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,871
Here...

318
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,834
...and here.

319
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,713
Now, as for the hadrosaurus...
