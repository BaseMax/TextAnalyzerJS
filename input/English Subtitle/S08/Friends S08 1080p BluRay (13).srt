1
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:10,634
All right, it's a new day.
That stuff about Rachel?

2
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:16,473
You don't feel that now. It was crazy.
You're fine. You're better than fine.

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:21,937
You are, as your friend Tony
would say, "Great!"

4
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:28,152
Everything's normal.
She's just your friend, Rachel.

5
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:34,033
Your friend, Rachel.
Your friend. Rachel.

6
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:41,081
- Hi, sweetie.
- Hey, it's your girlfriend, Rachel!

7
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,667
Hi.

8
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,754
Are you...? Are you high?

9
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,091
I had the most amazing bath.

10
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,677
- Really? I don't like baths.
- You like them with me.

11
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:39,973
Honey, it's not the bath I enjoy.
It's the wet, naked lady.

12
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:44,728
- Baths are so relaxing.
- Really? What do you do?

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,857
You just sit in there,
stewing in your own filth.

14
00:01:50,068 --> 00:01:52,528
How dirty do you think I am?

15
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:57,407
If you had some candles and bubbles
and music, you'd love it.

16
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,701
It'd take all your stress away.

17
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:05,624
It's 2:00 on Wednesday, I'm watching
Road Rules. How stressed am I?

18
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:11,713
Hey, Chandler.
I really need to talk to you.

19
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:16,343
Oh, uh, yeah. Is this a cold pizza
or a leftover-meat loaf talk?

20
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:21,473
- Well, neither.
- Oh, my God, what's up?

21
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:28,772
I don't know. It's just...
Lately, I've been feeling...

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,900
Okay, here's what it is. Heh.

23
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:41,702
- I feel a lot better. Thanks.
- Wait a minute. Just come back.

24
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:49,001
Okay. You and Monica,
friends for a long time.

25
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:53,755
And sure, there are rules.
But then you went to London.

26
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:58,719
But that's different. There are rules
there too, know what I mean?

27
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,179
Do you?

28
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:08,145
It was different for you guys.
You were both in the same place.

29
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,354
- In London.
- Yeah.

30
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,108
Yes, when Monica and I were
in London, we were both in London.

31
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,945
This is a bad idea. Forget all about it.

32
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:20,407
This conversation, between you and me.

33
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:23,160
If that.

34
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,627
Hi. Oh, Ross, don't forget
that doctor's appointment.

35
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,379
- Right.
- To find out the sex of the baby?

36
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,717
We don't wanna know
as long as it's happy and healthy.

37
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,970
- Yep, healthy. And cute.
- And smart.

38
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,139
- Popular.
- With an aptitude for science.

39
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,768
Are you two talking about the same baby?

40
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:52,564
- Have you thought of names?
- Oh, yeah. I've come up with a bunch.

41
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,359
- Really? Me too.
- Me too.

42
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,236
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

43
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:02,366
If it's a girl, Phoebe.
And if it's a boy, Pheebo.

44
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:09,248
Maybe. But it wouldn't hurt
to have a backup, you know?

45
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,708
- Rach, what were you thinking?
- Okay.

46
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,878
Um, I was thinking if it's a girl...

47
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:19,466
...how about Sandrene? It's French.
- Huh.

48
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:24,471
That's a really pretty name
for an industrial solvent.

49
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,015
Hmm.

50
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,560
- Fine. What do you have?
- It's for a boy.

51
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,647
I know it's a little out there, but...

52
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,108
...Darwin.

53
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,988
Our child will be beaten in the schoolyard.

54
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,699
Yeah, by Sandrene.

55
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,743
You're saying that
because I said no to you.

56
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,204
I'm really, really not.

57
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,832
How about you each get five vetoes?

58
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,583
- All right.
- That sounds fair.

59
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,420
I don't think you'll need it.

60
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,090
If it's a girl, Rain.

61
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,136
- Veto.
- Why?

62
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,764
Rain? "Hi, my name is Rain.

63
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:13,061
I have my own kiln,
and my dress is made out of wheat."

64
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,398
I know her!

65
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:20,569
I bought a homemade soap
from her at a Dead show!

66
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:27,367
- Okay. How about for a guy, Thatcher?
- Why do you hate our child?

67
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:30,370
- Fine, you go.
- Okay. James.

68
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,663
Huh.

69
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,166
- But only if it's a girl.
- Oh, veto.

70
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,918
I like Ruth. What about Ruth?

71
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:41,006
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are we having an 89-year-old?

72
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:45,344
- How about Dayton?
- Veto. Stewart.

73
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,179
Veto. Sawyer.

74
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,723
- Veto. Helen.
- Veto.

75
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:54,353
Is it me, or is Veto starting
to sound really good?

76
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,482
Hey.

77
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,610
Boy, do I have a surprise for you.

78
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,695
Sex on the balcony?

79
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:07,949
No. But someone's not gonna
get over that idea.

80
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,369
- What?
- I drew you a bath.

81
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:15,415
I don't like baths. Could you draw me
a picture of sex on the balcony?

82
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,543
Try it for me. I used all my best stuff.

83
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:24,091
I lit candles, I put on music.
I used bath salts, plus bubble bath.

84
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:29,554
And got you this little plastic
Navy ship! So it's a boy bath.

85
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:35,936
- This does butch it up a bit.
- I swear, you will love it.

86
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,231
If I do this, can we discuss balcony sex?

87
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,732
Absolutely.

88
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,445
But I know how
that discussion's gonna go.

89
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,953
Who can say where the road goes?

90
00:06:53,788 --> 00:07:00,043
All right, this isn't bad.
I like the flowery smell.

91
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:04,631
Which is okay, because I've got my boat.

92
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:10,262
- So?
- Oh, my God.

93
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:15,725
I told you you were a bath person.
Hey, maybe I can give you a facial.

94
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:19,020
I'm gonna need a bigger boat.

95
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,949
I don't think you had
an open mind about Ruth.

96
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,202
Little Ruthie Geller? How cute is that?

97
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:39,499
Oh, my God, I can practically
hear the mahjong tiles.

98
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:45,255
All your tests look fine. Are you
interested in the sex of the baby?

99
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,509
- No, we're not.
- You have it right there?

100
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:55,474
You know if it's a boy or a girl?
Dayton or Sandrene? Phoebe or Pheebo?

101
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,059
But if you don't wanna know...

102
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,771
- No, we wanna wait. Right?
- Right. Right.

103
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,984
Oh, I'll be right back.

104
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:08,945
I know it's really not my place...

105
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,866
...but please don't name
your child Pheebo.

106
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:20,999
So, which of these babies is the ugliest?

107
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:24,169
What? Rach, come on, that's terrible.

108
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:27,255
They're babies. They're all beautiful.

109
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:31,510
- Third one from the left?
- Yeah. Why is it staring at me?

110
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:37,974
I think it knows I'm talking about it.
Don't you...? You're looking!

111
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,643
- I didn't!
- I saw you!

112
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,395
Fine, I did, but I didn't see anything.

113
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:46,191
Shame on you! Ugly baby judges you!

114
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,904
- But I didn't...
- Don't tell me! I don't wanna know!

115
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,573
I couldn't, because I don't know!

116
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:58,495
I swear I didn't see anything!
It was just a momentary lapse.

117
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,957
"Momentary lapse."
Don't you have any self-control?

118
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:06,628
Okay. A couple months late
on the lecture, Ross.

119
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:11,424
Hello?

120
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:15,637
Can you come in here?
There's something wrong.

121
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:18,932
You know what?
I think I'll wait out here.

122
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,186
- I'm in the bathtub.
- Oh.

123
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:29,109
- What's wrong?
- I drew a bath, but I did it wrong.

124
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:34,990
The water's tepid, the salt didn't
dissolve and is now lodged places.

125
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:41,037
And the scents I used don't compliment
each other. Eucalyptus and chamomile? Oh!

126
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,957
- What?
- Bath salts.

127
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,960
They're starting to effervesce.

128
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:52,924
It's different. It's interesting.

129
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,885
Let's talk about something else.

130
00:09:56,137 --> 00:10:00,432
Yeah. Sure. So, what was
going on with you today?

131
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:05,020
I actually had the weirdest
conversation with Joey.

132
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:08,773
He was talking about rules
and right and wrong.

133
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:13,069
- I had the same conversation.
- What was he talking about?

134
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,783
He hasn't had this much trouble getting
out words since he was in Macbeth.

135
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:25,707
- That was a long night.
- What exactly did he say to you?

136
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:31,004
He was talking about rules
and looking at people differently.

137
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:33,548
- Not to me.
- What'd he tell you?

138
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:36,843
He asked about you, me and London.

139
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:41,222
And the glue that holds
this all together, the rules.

140
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:45,393
Okay. So you, me and London.

141
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,313
Looking at people differently.

142
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:52,233
Maybe he wants to do
what you and I did in London.

143
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,694
But what'd he mean by "rules"?

144
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,782
Wait. He stopped talking
the minute Phoebe came in.

145
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:03,036
- He's looking at her differently.
- Phoebe is his friend.

146
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,455
That'd be breaking the rules.

147
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,917
My God, he wants to do it
with Phoebe in London!

148
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:12,420
- You guys?
- Um, just a minute!

149
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,966
- That's Mrs. Tribbiani.
- You don't say anything.

150
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:22,806
Why would I? That two of our friends
could start a great love affair?

151
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:27,644
They'd have me to thank.
Then we could all start having babies!

152
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:31,147
- I won't let you say anything.
- Stay here.

153
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,525
Oh, God!

154
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,447
Oh. I brought back your iron.

155
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:43,159
You had that? I thought I lost it.
I got a new one a month ago.

156
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:46,788
Oh, just as well. I broke this one.

157
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,211
- What?
- Nothing.

158
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,296
Okay.

159
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,342
I really shouldn't say.
I'm really not supposed to.

160
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,844
Fine.

161
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:06,933
- It's a humdinger.
- Too bad you can't tell me.

162
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,728
Somebody likes you!

163
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,401
- Ugh. Is it Chandler?
- No!

164
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:20,822
- Then tell him to stop staring.
- It's Joey.

165
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,702
Really? Joey? You don't say.

166
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:30,582
- Would you be interested?
- I don't know, I don't know.

167
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:36,004
You know, I mean, on the one hand,
"Mother, may I?"

168
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,758
But, you know, on the other hand...

169
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,387
No. No, I can't. We're friends.

170
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:47,307
Oh, no. I don't wanna risk
what we have.

171
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:52,771
I guess that makes sense.
You think you're gonna talk to him?

172
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,484
Sure. I mean, it's Joey.
I don't want him to get hurt.

173
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:01,529
Well, I must say, I am on fire!
First Chandler, now Joey.

174
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:06,618
- Not Chandler. Just Joey.
- Sure.

175
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,127
- Hi.
- Hey.

176
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,881
You know what?
I'm coming around on the name Ruth.

177
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,842
I'd consider naming our child that.

178
00:13:23,427 --> 00:13:29,307
Rach, I can't tell you
how much that means to me. Oh...

179
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:34,270
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

180
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,526
You hated the name Ruth.
Why would you change your mind?

181
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,446
Unless you know we're never
gonna have to use it.

182
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,533
You did see. You know it's a boy!

183
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,036
I didn't see anything. I changed my mind.

184
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:53,122
I don't think so. You're giving me Ruth...

185
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:56,584
...so you get to name him
when it's a boy.

186
00:13:56,836 --> 00:14:02,715
That's when you'll swoop in and
name him Heath or Blaine or Sequoia.

187
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,218
I would... Sequoia!

188
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:08,429
- Veto.
- Fine.

189
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:17,564
Unless you anticipated that
I would figure all this out...

190
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,150
...and you know that it actually is a girl.

191
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,863
And you really do want her
to be named Ruth.

192
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:30,743
Well, I'm not falling for that!
Okay? Ruth is off the table!

193
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:36,374
- But, Ross, you want the name Ruth.
- Not like this!

194
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:42,130
- Hey.
- Hey. What's up?

195
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:46,426
- Um, Joey, I know.
- What?

196
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:52,015
- I know.
- What?

197
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:56,853
- I know about your feelings.
- Oh, my God, you do?

198
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:02,275
I'm sorry. Things worked out for
Chandler and Monica, but that's rare.

199
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:07,697
I know. And this is so much more
complicated than it was for them.

200
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,409
I mean, it's Rachel, for God's sakes.

201
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,788
For God's sakes, it's Rachel!

202
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:20,919
I know! She's not only my friend,
she's my pregnant friend.

203
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,922
She's my pregnant friend who's Ross' ex!

204
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:29,552
Yeah, that's Rachel.
Beat me over the head with it.

205
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:35,391
What am I gonna do? I keep trying
to get rid of these feelings.

206
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,187
I made a list of everything
I don't like about her.

207
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,439
- You wanna hear it?
- Yeah.

208
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,989
"She made me switch to light mayo."
That's it! That's all I got!

209
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:54,369
You know what? Tastes the same
and my pants fit better.

210
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,455
Joey, you're getting upset for nothing.

211
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:00,667
- This is probably just a crush.
- You think?

212
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:05,129
Absolutely. You get this rush
of feelings, but it goes away.

213
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:09,842
Yeah, just a crush.
That's all this is. It's a crush!

214
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,929
I'm Joey. I don't get deep feelings.

215
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:16,057
There you go.
Crushes happen all the time.

216
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:21,479
I've had them for all you guys.
Except for Ross and Chandler.

217
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:26,693
- And I'm sure you've had them for us.
- Not really.

218
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,029
Throw me a bone here.

219
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,541
So I, uh... I called the doctor.

220
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:46,295
- Now we both know the sex of the baby.
- What?

221
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,633
That's right.
The student has become the master.

222
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:56,806
- Ross, I swear. I don't know.
- Oh, come on, you know it's a girl.

223
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,977
- A what?
- You really didn't know?

224
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,813
- We're having a girl?
- No.

225
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,898
- That's what you said.
- No.

226
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:10,236
- You said girl.
- Yes. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

227
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:12,822
I'm not! We're having a girl!

228
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:18,411
Sometimes I can't believe it's with
you, but still, we're having a girl!

229
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,915
I know! You know what?
I'm putting Ruth back on the table.

230
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:28,004
Yes, we'll have ourselves a little baby Ruth.

231
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,093
- Permission to veto.
- Yes, please.

232
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,603
- Hey.
- Do I smell essential oils?

233
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:46,397
I'm gonna take a bath.
I was gonna get a magazine.

234
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,982
Okay.

235
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,375
What do you think you're doing?

236
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,253
Leaving my troubles behind?

237
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:14,509
You're new at this,
but this is unacceptable bath decorum.

238
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,387
It's so hard to care
when you're this relaxed.

239
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,600
You can have the bath,
but I am taking your boat.

240
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,853
Now you're just a girl in a tub.

241
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:31,609
- Hey!
- Hi, bubbles. Manly.

242
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,487
I thought I'd let you know how it went.

243
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,366
- You told her?
- She pulled it out of me!

244
00:18:38,575 --> 00:18:42,453
She's like a conversational wizard!
How did it go?

245
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:45,998
- You were wrong. He doesn't like me.
- What?

246
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:50,586
How would you like it if I told you
that Lee Majors liked you...

247
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:54,966
...and you found out that he didn't like you?
How would you feel?

248
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:02,265
- I don't think I'd care.
- Really? Lee Majors is hot.

249
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:07,270
- Hello?
- We're in the bathroom!

250
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:12,316
- Why?
- Because it's a relaxing and enjoyable time!

251
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:17,697
- What are you guys doing in here?
- Oh, my God.

252
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:22,535
A friend he's looking at differently,
but it's wrong.

253
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:25,163
- It's Rachel!
- You like Rachel?

254
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:30,251
It's no big deal. Phoebe and I talked.
It's a crush. It'll go away.

255
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:33,754
Dude, you gotta rearrange your bubbles.

256
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,717
Mazel tov.

257
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:42,722
Hey. Oh, hi.
Ross and I were looking for you.

258
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:47,226
What are we all doing in here? Oh, my.

259
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:52,607
Honey, cover it up with the boat.

260
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:53,983
Hello?

261
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:58,112
We're all in here,
and we'd love for you to join us!

262
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:06,078
Well, hey! What's going on?
Oh, cool boat. Oh, no.

263
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,791
- Did you tell them?
- I waited for you.

264
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,544
- Tell us what?
- We're having a girl.

265
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:19,217
Oh, wow! Really? Oh, my God!

266
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,012
I'll get you later.

267
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:32,438
All right. It's a new day.
And it's just a crush.

268
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:35,358
That's all. Just a little crush.

269
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:39,403
All that worrying I was doing?
That was crazy. Crazy.

270
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:44,283
Like my friend the bird here
would say, "It was cuckoo!"

271
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:52,208
Everything's gonna be fine.
It's just a crush.

272
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,796
- Hi, sweetie.
- I love you.

273
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:07,932
It's nice to do this together,
isn't it?

274
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,228
Yeah. And what you're doing
feels so good.

275
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:16,315
- I'm not touching you.
- You're not?

276
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:21,487
- It's the salts.
- Sweet Lord, new realms of pleasure.

277
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,951
Whatever keeps you
off the balcony, big guy.
