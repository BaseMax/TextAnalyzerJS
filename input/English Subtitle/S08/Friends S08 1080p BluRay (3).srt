1
00:00:03,294 --> 00:00:07,089
- Are you excited about our honeymoon?
- Yeah, I am.

2
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,384
Bermuda, Bahama
Come on, pretty mama

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:14,138
Get it out of your system
while we're alone.

4
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:18,267
- We came to say goodbye.
- Have a great honeymoon.

5
00:00:18,476 --> 00:00:20,269
- Thanks.
- I'll go pack.

6
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:24,940
I already packed. The only thing
I couldn't find, though, was your Speedo.

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:31,113
Speedo? Uh, I don't have a Speedo.

8
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:35,826
I'm gonna go pack
my regular, long bathing suit.

9
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,873
Good, you're still here. I wanted
to tell you to have a good honeymoon.

10
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,958
Oh, thank you.

11
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:47,463
And I wanted you guys to know
that I am telling the father today.

12
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,385
What? What? What?

13
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:58,432
- We know it's Ross.
- How? How do you know?

14
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,643
It was his sweater. But, oh, my God!

15
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:06,106
I so wanted Ross to know first.
But I'm so relieved that you guys know.

16
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:10,152
- That's so great. I'll be your baby's aunt!
- I know.

17
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:15,282
- Me too!
- I'm gonna be an uncle! Come here.

18
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:20,120
- You'll all be aunts and uncles.
- But I'm the only one related by blood.

19
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:27,127
Okay, great. Now that you all know,
you can give me advice on how to tell Ross.

20
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,879
What were you gonna say?

21
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:33,383
That I'm gonna have the baby,
and he can be as involved as he wants.

22
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,260
Well, that sounds good.

23
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:39,139
Yeah, but how do I start?
What's the first thing that I say?

24
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,939
- Okay, great. Thanks.
- Hey, good luck.

25
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,483
Yeah, bye.

26
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,193
What was that all about?

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:56,156
Well, I guess no harm in telling you now.
Rachel and Ross are having a baby.

28
00:01:56,366 --> 00:02:02,412
What? I didn't
even know! Why didn't you tell me?

29
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:05,666
Why am I talking like this?

30
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,252
I didn't think
you could keep it a secret.

31
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:13,715
What? I'm an excellent
secret-keeper. I've kept all our secrets.

32
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,677
- What secrets?
- No, no, Joey.

33
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:21,723
I'm not gonna tell you because
I am an excellent secret-keeper.

34
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:27,354
- Psst. You'll tell me later?
- You already know.

35
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:14,610
It's so romantic to send people off
on their honeymoon.

36
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,780
You know, Monica and Chandler are married.
Ross and Rachel are having a baby.

37
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:25,120
- Maybe you and I should do something.
- All in good time, my love. All in good time.

38
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:31,001
Oh, shoot. I left my guitar in their apartment.
You can let me in later, right?

39
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,670
No, I don't have a key.
They took mine to give to you.

40
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:38,884
- What? They took mine to give to you.
- Why would they take away our keys?

41
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,594
Maybe they don't trust us.

42
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,680
They let me keep my key
the last time they were out of town.

43
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,183
You mean the time
you broke the ketchup bottle...

44
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:49,102
...and cleaned it up
with Monica's guest towels?

45
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,855
- I washed those.
- No, you didn't.

46
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:54,566
Yeah, that didn't sound like me.

47
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,488
- What am I gonna do? I really need my guitar.
- I have stuff in there too.

48
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:04,201
- What stuff?
- Monica's chicken parm. I'll take care of this.

49
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,121
Mr. Treeger? It's Joey Tribbiani.

50
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,459
I need to get into Monica
and Chandler's apartment. It's an emergency.

51
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,464
Uh... Uh... Gas leak.
Oh, and bring garlic bread.

52
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,717
- Hey.
- Hey.

53
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,595
- Did Rachel find you?
- No, why?

54
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:28,934
- She was looking for you.
- Well, I guess I'll catch up with her later.

55
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:34,523
- She really wanted to talk to you now.
- Yeah, it seemed pretty important.

56
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,195
- Oh, no.
- What?

57
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,864
I think I might know
what this is about.

58
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:47,077
Really?

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:52,666
Yeah. We promised we weren't
gonna tell anybody this...

60
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:57,713
...but a month ago,
Rachel and I slept together.

61
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,340
And?

62
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:09,808
- Wow, I thought you'd be more shocked.
- Oh, sorry. And?

63
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:18,150
Well, we said we'd just
do it that one time...

64
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:22,112
...but now I think she may
wanna start things up again.

65
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:25,032
Yeah, I don't think that's what it is.

66
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:31,288
- Why? What else could it be?
- Oh, wow, I don't feel well.

67
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:36,668
I'm telling you, I'm telling you,
that's what it is.

68
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:40,672
No wonder she was looking
at me all funny during the wedding.

69
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,425
She didn't say anything to you?

70
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,678
- Maybe it's something you ate.
- It could've been...

71
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:51,516
- Please, just go and talk to Rachel.
- Yeah, I guess I should.

72
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:55,854
Man, you know what I have to realize?

73
00:05:56,064 --> 00:06:00,067
Maybe I'm not the type of guy
women can have just one night with.

74
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:07,157
They always seem to want
a little bit more.

75
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,702
I should remember that.

76
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,963
Next.

77
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:26,051
- They're kissing. Let's go around them.
- Leave them alone. They're in love.

78
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,638
I'm in love too.
But in an orderly fashion.

79
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,933
- Next.
- Hi. Can you do that and walk?

80
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,143
Because she said, "Next."

81
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:40,232
Sorry, we didn't hear you.
We're on our honeymoon.

82
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:46,488
Aw. Let me see what I can do.
There are some first-class seats available.

83
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:50,283
They bumped them up to first class
because they're on their honeymoon.

84
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,452
Let's act like we're on our honeymoon.

85
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,122
We are on our honeymoon.

86
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:59,167
- Grab my ass.
- Next.

87
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:04,756
Sorry, I almost didn't hear you because
I'm so in love with my new husband.

88
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,926
- We're on our honeymoon.
- Congratulations.

89
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:13,265
Mr. Bing, you'll be in 25J,
and Mrs. Bing, you're in 25K.

90
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:18,103
We're on our honeymoon, so can you do
your little thing, bump us up to first class?

91
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:21,982
I'm sorry, all the first-class seats are taken.
That couple got the last two.

92
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:27,946
If we'd gone around them like I said,
she'd have given us those tickets. Damn it.

93
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:32,451
25J and K, any chance
those aren't together?

94
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,955
I still can't believe they took away my key.
You trust me with yours.

95
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,125
Of course I do.
And I'll give it back to you...

96
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,628
...as soon as they're done with it
at the key-shining place.

97
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,676
What the hell is that?

98
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:54,389
- Whoa, whoa. Treeger, what are you doing?
- You said there was a gas leak in here.

99
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,478
- Why don't you use your key?
- I won't find it before the place explodes.

100
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:03,523
If that happens at another building
I manage, people will start asking questions.

101
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,317
Come on, hurry up.

102
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:06,985
Oh!

103
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,031
We could have done that.

104
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,536
Look at that. They're going into
the first-class lounge.

105
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,955
- Do you know what they have in there?
- No.

106
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:21,750
Me neither. We have to get in!

107
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:26,254
- Just act like you belong.
- Oh, my God! Oranges!

108
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:27,923
Shh!

109
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:34,179
- Nice to see you again.
- Sir, may I see your tickets, please?

110
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,056
Yes, of course.

111
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:39,768
Would you move your thumb.
I can't see the seat number.

112
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:43,813
That's all right.
I have it memorized. It's 1A.

113
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:49,653
- Sir, this isn't a first-class ticket. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted. Excuse us.

114
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:54,616
Sir, I'm afraid I'm going
to have to ask you to leave.

115
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,826
Fine.

116
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,996
Go, go, go!

117
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,386
- Hi.
- Hi.

118
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,762
Hi.

119
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:20,141
I think there's something that
we really need to talk about.

120
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:24,980
I think we do.
Why don't we go inside.

121
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,485
- Hi.
- Hi.

122
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:35,323
- Look, I know why you're here.
- You do?

123
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:41,621
Yeah, and to save you from any
embarrassment, I think I should talk first.

124
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,707
- Okay.
- Okay.

125
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,292
Here.

126
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:58,847
Ross and Rachel.
Rachel and Ross. Heh.

127
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:03,852
It's been one heck of a seesaw,
hasn't it?

128
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:05,895
What?

129
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:12,819
I mean, look, that one night we had
was fun and certainly passionate.

130
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:16,781
But don't you think it's better
if we just stay friends?

131
00:10:18,909 --> 00:10:20,827
Seriously, what?

132
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:25,582
Okay, okay. You know what?

133
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,711
If you want to,
we can do it one more time.

134
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:38,094
I'd be okay with that.
In fact, I have some time right now.

135
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,641
- You know what? Ahem. Can I talk now?
- Oh, sure.

136
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,982
I'm pregnant.

137
00:10:55,071 --> 00:11:03,078
Ross?

138
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,665
Okay, whenever you're ready.

139
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,258
And you're the father, by the way.
But you're good.

140
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:33,483
- Can I get you some water?
- I'm good, I'm good.

141
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:40,115
Ross, there is no pressure on you. Okay?
You can be as involved as you want.

142
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:49,916
Yeah, I, uh... I'm just, I don't know.
I don't understand...

143
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,878
...how this happened.

144
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:59,300
- We used a condom.
- I know.

145
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:04,556
But you know, condoms only work,
like, 97 percent of the time.

146
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:07,016
What? What?

147
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,979
What?

148
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:15,650
Well, they should put that on the box!

149
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:20,572
- They do.
- No, they don't!

150
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,749
Well, they should put it
in huge block letters!

151
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:36,588
- Let's just forget about the condoms.
- Well, I may as well have!

152
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:44,804
- Listen, I was really freaked out too when...
- Freaked out? No, I'm not freaked out.

153
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:48,475
I'm indignant as a consumer!

154
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:53,688
- You know what? Let's talk later.
- No. No, I wanna talk now.

155
00:12:53,898 --> 00:13:00,737
In fact, I wanna talk to
the president of the condom company.

156
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,157
- Okay, maybe I should come back...
- Shh!

157
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,494
Yeah, I'll press one!

158
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:16,669
- I looked everywhere. There's no gas leak.
- So now I can heat this up?

159
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:19,464
Anyway, I'll get moving on that new door.

160
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:24,636
Great. And could you do us a favor and
not tell Chandler and Monica about this?

161
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:28,306
Because, you know,
they don't have any kids of their own...

162
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,935
...and this door was
like a child to them.

163
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,355
I have to put on a new lock.
They'll find out anyway.

164
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,065
Oh, no.

165
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:43,029
This looks like an all-day job.
I'll have to cancel my yoga class.

166
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,531
- Hey, Ross.
- Hey.

167
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,699
Could you tell Jasmine
I can't make it to yoga?

168
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:47,992
Sure.

169
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:57,752
- My God. What happened to the door?
- So it's noticeable, huh?

170
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:01,548
- Is Rachel here? I really need to talk to her.
- Didn't you two already talk?

171
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,008
Yeah, but...

172
00:14:04,301 --> 00:14:09,180
Okay, look. You guys know Rachel and I slept
together, but there's something else.

173
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:13,351
Rachel's pregnant.

174
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:16,980
- Holy mother of God!
- Oh, my God! I can't believe it!

175
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:24,279
- With my child.
- That is brand-new information!

176
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:32,203
- You already know, don't you?
- A little bit.

177
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,165
- How you doing?
- Okay. Okay. I mean, I'll be okay.

178
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,835
It's just I don't think
I handled it very well.

179
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,170
- What did you say to her?
- Nothing.

180
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:46,134
But the complaint department
at the condom company got an earful.

181
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:48,136
Then when I turned around,
she was gone.

182
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,762
Oh, Ross.

183
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:55,184
But in my defense, I found out
that condoms are only 97 percent effective.

184
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,062
- What?
- I gotta go find her.

185
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:04,944
Hold on! Are you serious? So, like,
3 percent of the time they don't even work?

186
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:08,781
Huh? They should put that on the box!

187
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,577
- Evidently, they do.
- What?

188
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,381
- I can't believe we're here.
- You've gotta be kidding.

189
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,091
What?

190
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:32,722
As a wedding gift to you, the hotel would
like to give you the Honeymoon Suite.

191
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:36,392
No! You have been screwing us all day!

192
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:40,688
- Who are you?
- We're you. Just 10 seconds later!

193
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:46,235
You already got the first-class tickets,
the lounge. We should get free stuff too!

194
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:49,530
You're not the only ones
on your honeymoon!

195
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:54,994
You can have the suite, if you want.
We don't care about where we stay.

196
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:59,582
We're here to celebrate our love for
each other. We don't have to get free stuff.

197
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,043
We just want to be together.

198
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,673
We need the stuff.

199
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,471
Hey, Monica, it's Joey. Phoebe and I
smell gas coming from your apartment.

200
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:18,768
- Are you serious? Joey smells gas.
- What else is new?

201
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:23,773
- We'd check it out, but you took our keys.
- Do something. Get in there!

202
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:28,361
- How? I guess I could break down your door.
- Yeah, do that.

203
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,823
- You won't blame us for any damage?
- No.

204
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:38,538
- Are you doing it? I can't hear anything.
- Okay, I'll break it down.

205
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:46,421
He's doing it,
he's breaking down the door.

206
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,551
Okay, we're in.

207
00:16:55,597 --> 00:17:00,560
- Rachel, are you comfortable?
- If I said I was, would you judge me?

208
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,146
The doctor will be here soon
to do your sonogram.

209
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,564
Okay.

210
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:13,156
Oh, man, I swear, if they sold
these at Pottery Barn...

211
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,409
- Hi.
- Hi.

212
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,327
We need to talk.

213
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,582
Right now? I kind of got an alfresco
situation going on over here.

214
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:27,962
Please. Please, I want to apologize
for the way I acted earlier today.

215
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,924
- That's fine. Can you stay up near my head?
- Yeah, sorry.

216
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:37,847
I went crazy. I was thinking about myself
when I should've been thinking about you.

217
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,308
- Head, Ross. Head, Ross. Head, Ross.
- Right.

218
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:45,021
I want you to know that I'll be
there through this whole thing. Okay?

219
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,318
The doctor's appointments, Lamaze classes,
baby-proofing the apartment.

220
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:54,072
- We can do that after we get married.
- Married?

221
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:55,948
Yeah, we should get married.

222
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:59,118
Because that's your answer
to everything?

223
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:04,082
No, because that's the right thing to do.

224
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:09,879
Yeah, maybe, if you're in love.
But, Ross, we are not in love, are we?

225
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:15,676
No, but still, I mean,
you can't possibly do this alone.

226
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,386
Excuse me?

227
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:22,350
Come on, you can't even eat alone
in a restaurant.

228
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,061
- What?
- I'm saying if you can't eat by yourself...

229
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,188
...how can you have a baby by yourself?

230
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:30,942
- I can too eat by myself.
- When have you ever?

231
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,822
When certain people leave the table
and I am not finished!

232
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,492
Well, certain other people take two hours
to eat a bowl of soup.

233
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,953
Please, you inhale your food.

234
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:45,456
I grew up with Monica. If you
didn't eat fast, you didn't eat!

235
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,878
Am I interrupting?

236
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,674
No, Dr. Long, please come in.
This is Ross, he's the father.

237
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:58,928
But not the husband,
because she can do this alone.

238
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:03,307
Nice to meet you.
I'll get started on this.

239
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:10,398
- Why can't you admit you need me?
- I need you. I need you to stay near my head!

240
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:16,904
Okay. Everything looks good.
Here it is on the screen.

241
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,949
There's your uterus...

242
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,245
...and right here is your baby.

243
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,332
Oh, my God.

244
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,418
Wow.

245
00:19:31,753 --> 00:19:34,213
There it is, I see it.

246
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:38,384
Congratulations.
I'll give you two a minute.

247
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,761
Thank you.

248
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,062
Pretty amazing, huh?

249
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,899
I don't see it!

250
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:05,077
- What? What?
- I can't see it.

251
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,623
- You just said that you did.
- I know, I lied.

252
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:12,877
I didn't want her to think I was a terrible
mother. I can't even see my own baby.

253
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:19,050
Come here. Sure you can.
Come here. Look, it's right there.

254
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,054
Oh.

255
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,016
Oh, it's beautiful.

256
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,144
I see it now.

257
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,732
- Do you really?
- No, I don't see it!

258
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:37,610
Okay, come on. Come on.
All right. Okay. Okay.

259
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:43,199
You see this tiny thing
that looks like a peanut?

260
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,076
Yeah.

261
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,787
Sweetie, that's it.

262
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:52,541
That's it? Well, I saw that.

263
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,712
Oh.

264
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,175
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

265
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:08,849
Wow, I can't believe that's our baby.

266
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,730
Yeah, that's our baby.

267
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,491
- Hi.
- Hey.

268
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,245
- So how was the doctor?
- Everything went great.

269
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,873
- Good.
- Hey, show them the picture of your uterus.

270
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,211
Aw.

271
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,673
I don't see the baby. Where is it?

272
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:45,511
I know, I couldn't see it either
at first. But it's right, um...

273
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,347
Ross, I lost it again.
